The past year and a half I've been doing a lot better, but recently it's back. Two weeks ago it was so bad I felt lost again and I decided to help myself instead of letting it go unnoticed. I told my closest friends and family. It was the hardest thing I've had to do in a long time but I did it. Different styles of conversation but same main point. I'm still down but the best thing I've ever done was tell someone. I'm working everyday, even if just by a hair, to better my mental health. I still have a long way to go but the people I told and God are getting me through it. I've never posted about any of this but I hope something I wrote here hits home and it helps you."", '1': ""I feel ya. I've had depression for several years but it got SO much worse with some serious family drama that happened about 5-7 years ago. It was so bad I don't talk to half of my family anymore. I have times at work still where I want to break down and cry if I think about it too much or if its a bad day. I actually did break down and start crying one time in the bathroom and I'm not the kind of girl to bring makeup in my purse so it was just awkward. But I felt better after I cried and just acted like I was completely fine. SPEAKING of that...you mention that you saw your therapist. I hope you're getting something out of it and that he/she is helping you because I've never found a therapist that I like who also really helps me. I think I also have a hard time with actually being honest. I'm so used to putting on a brave face and being in denial of my severe depression because I have to do it so often I don't even realize I'm doing it in therapy. I'm not sure if that's helpful at all but I hope it is "", '2': 'I can relate to this. I was sexually abused by quite a few people in my life. First, my brother. I was around 7, he was 8. Then that grew into him and his friend Jack intimidating me with weapons to show them my body and let them touch me. I thought that was over, but when I was 11 I would wake up to my brother in my room, standing over me. This happened every so often for a few months.\n\nWe went to Disney World and one night, I woke up. I decided to pretend I was still sleeping. He was touching me all over and jerking off over me. He left the room eventually and I immediately told my stepmom. I remember her crying and hugging me, and me being in shock for the whole day, not speaking. Then we finally went to go eat at a restaurant that night and it all came out; I started sobbing and couldn\'t control myself.\n\nThe years after that were hard. I started showing my body to men online (even though I was 11, that continued for awhile, even into adulthood). I started self harming. I went from being a straight A student to failing everything and having no hope for life.\n\nIn high school I began using drugs and drinking alcohol. And smoking cigarettes. I pretty much took anything I could get my hands on. I was very emotionally unstable at this point, always had cuts on my arms that were visible at school, and would sleep underneath my desk in most of my classes. None of my teachers ever said anything to me. They never pressed the issue or asked if anything was wrong.\n\nMy first boyfriend at 16 was emotionally abusive and didn\'t respect my boundaries when we had sex. He belittled me in front of friends and called me a whore often, though he was cheating and I wasn\'t.\n\nThat ended and I dated another guy at 17-18. Heavy into drug use and severely suicidal and emotionally unstable, I was the turbulent one in this relationship. The volatile and angry one. He never touched me or hurt me at this point but he was emotionally distant and honestly didn\'t seem that into me. This made me become more reactive. I\'m not saying it was right for me to be that way though. But I still felt guilty. He didn\'t respect me much, but looking back I couldn\'t have respected him much either with the way I treated him.\n\nFor a little bit we had been trying anal. I couldn\'t really get into it much because it was painful to me, so I told him I didn\'t want to try anymore.\nBut one day we had sex and he forced himself into me anyways. I went into shock again this time and I just remember lying there, staring at the ground, limp like a rag doll, crying and saying no. But I don\'t think he heard me.\nAt least that\'s what he said.\n\nI was admitted into three different mental hospitals within a month for suicide attempts. FYI mental hospitals suck and you\'re not treated much like someone struggling, but more like a prisoner and someone that can\'t be trusted and is undeserving of empathy.\n\nIt\'s like that Stanford experiment from the 70s where they had participants sign up to either be a prisoner or prison guard and play out the parts. The experiment was ended early because the participants started being violent towards each other and took their roles too seriously, despite knowing that the experiment was staged.\nThat\'s how it is in mental hospitals. There\'s an us vs. them mentality that needs to be fixed.\n\nAnyways, my mom decided that we should move to Florida, because at this point I had pretty much lost my damn mind. I remember many days lost to my memory because of taking near-death amounts of Xanax and ending up in people\'s driveways, or the cops calling my mom to come pick me up. I don\'t remember this, but apparently I went to find my boyfriend at his friends house and started trying to fuck up his car (I didn\'t at all lol) and then calling out to him. Apparently I knocked on the next door neighbor\'s door and asked if they knew where he was. But unfortunately for me that neighbor happened to be a cop, home for the night from duty.\n\nMoving to Florida was not fun at first. I didn\'t have any connections for drugs anymore so I would go on dates just to get alcohol. I know it\'s terrible. My self-esteem and value for myself were so low. I even dated somebody because they had free Xanax, Adderall, cocaine, ketamine, weed, and acid to share with me.\n\nEventually I found natural herbs as supplements for these drugs and though I\'m addicted to one, it\'s way better than what I was doing before.\n\nMy life was gaining a feeling of purpose. I found waiting jobs at first and started making friends with people, due to this community of cafes in my area that all sell these herb alternatives. It\'s a really large community.\n\n I dated somebody who for the first time, wasn\'t abusive. It was a step up. We ended up breaking up because it was codependent as hell and he had no motivation or purpose in his life, but it was way better than before. \n\nI had done graphic design as a kid and by luck, had a yoga studio owner see my value and pay me to design though my experience was lacking due to years of not pursuing design. \n\nShe eventually let me go but has recommended me to both the jobs I had afterwards. A job at a local agency that way underpaid me (but was good experience). And my current job, doing freelance for a local branding expert who only works with clients who are actively trying to help people (like life coaches and the like). So now I do website development and content writing. And I get to write about spirituality and self-actualization.\n\nWhen I was 16 I had discovered Buddhism but didn\'t have the sanity or self control to instill the morals into my own life.\n\nNow I have all the tools for healing. I was diagnosed with complex PTSD two years ago. It took years of therapists as a kid telling me I was dramatic and manipulative for someone to finally see what I was suffering with. That it wasn\'t just GAD and depression. \n\nI don\'t feel like a lost cause anymore. I feel like my life has purpose. I\'m like you, I\'m still depressed. I find it hard to self-motivate pretty often and will let my chores and responsibilities slide (mostly chores lol). I have flashbacks every now and then and do disassociate still, but I\'m not waking up every day destroying myself anymore. I\'m healing and exploring new methods of healing. I\'m dating someone. My bar for acceptable relationships has grown from, ""he doesn\'t hurt me"" to, ""he makes me feel fulfilled and happy"". \n\nI can now calm myself down in my anger or sadness (not all the time). But I can rationalize with myself now. I never was able to before.\n\nI don\'t know why but your story inspired me to share with you. I feel like it was very sincere and heart felt. I\'ve only ever written down this full story in my own journal, never to anyone else. When I tell people, I don\'t go into the details. I figured out pretty quick that people don\'t wanna hear em usually.\n\nBut thank you to anyone that reads this. And maybe it can help others realize that living with trauma is not a hopeless death sentence. It can get better.\n\n', '3': ""Wow, so sorry for your loss that must have been so traumatic. Have you ever been treated for depression?\nMy depression stems from my childhood both of my parents are drug addicts so I've never had a family. So of course I grew up extremely poor and constantly changed schools never made any friends, didn't go to college until I was in my mid twenties so didn't make any lasting relationships there either. I've been a stripper for a while and I don't really have much in common with those women so no friends there either. I've managed to avoid any major damage from dancing no drug habits hooking etc but it's still very isolating. Aside from a string of bad relationships I've been alone my entire life. Twice in the last two years I thought I'd met someone who I liked and thought they felt the same way only to get tricked/rejected.I'm an honest person with pure intentions so I tend to be very naive and it always gets me hurt. I think I've finally learned after much heartache how to avoid abusive relationships. But it's like a cycle I cannot seem to do the things I need to do to improve myself and I think that there is no way anyone can love me the way I am. Who wants a stripper with drug addict parents. I'm almost done with my degree and I'm not even excited about that I'm not excited about anything. I honestly don't think anything will ever change it's a cycle I'm always going to be fucked up because of my depression. "", '4': ""I started to have depression when I was 7 due mostly to the abuse of my parents. I saw a therapist for about a year and it certainly helped but years down the line it became worse again.\n\nIt wasn't until I was 16 when I finally got the help I needed. My mother too finally got the idea she needed to treat me better, and has become nicer over the years.\n\nWith my break up 2 months ago tho, my ex really messed me up for a while and I am back in therapy and finally recovering and am stable again. I don't think I will stop going to therapy from now on. At least progressing to every 2 or 3 months as i get better.\n\nIf u suffer from depression, you need to see A therapist or your disease will eat you alive."", '5': 'Reading your post made me cry. I read your post and saw myself in every word. I too have been broken up with my boyfriend who i love dearly for the last month and a half. However unlike you and your boyfriend we have no self control. We still love each other very much and we talk daily. When we first decided to break up the decision was not my own, like you my boyfriend made the decision. He stated he wanted to make sure if this was really what we both wanted. Two days later he told me he couldn’t do this. Every week since then i tell him we need to stop or he tells me. I suffer from BPD and Bipolar disorder and have tried to kill my self a total of about a half a dozen times since our break up. He knows of two attempts. A few days ago being my last and most closest time. I hadn’t drank or eaten in 5 days i felt dizzy and knew my time was coming. But i wanted to see him. He forced me to eat and sat with my for 5 hours. But he told me we have to try to walk away for a little. I asked him will we ever go back to normal he said he doesn’t know. Being with my boyfriend was the happiest time in my life. Before him i was being verbally and mentally abused by my mother. I finally got my own place but could feel no happiness and decided to take my own life. Funny thing my boyfriend begged me to come out that day, i never thought i fall for him but he saved my life. This has been even more painful than my sexual assault combined. \nI know that was long but just to say this to you i know how it feels. To have someone who basically makes your life worth living leave. We may not truly understand this, and we may never go back to being in relationship. And that hurts very much. I can’t say what will happen to either of us from this point. I just want to let you know i hope your boyfriend is relieved of all his problems and he comes back to you. That is my hope for you. Love shouldn’t die because of someone’s outside fears, problems, and it misunderstandings. And from the looks of things he loves you very much. ', '6': ""I don't regret telling my friends but I hated having to tell my parents. I've had to do it a couple times because I wasn't doing well in college and I didn't tell them. Each time my dad was furious at me for not saying anything, and yet he didn't want to talk about it. Their response was to pull me out of college, lock me it the house, keep me away from friends who understood and cared, and then never talked to me about my depression or anxiety.  My dad would just glare and drop snide remarks about how I need to work harder and just push forward, but he offered no help. I was stuck at my house for about a year, and in that time all I did was get worse. My day was to wake up, clean the house, and go to sleep. I feel like they never wanted me to improve, they just wanted me under their control and work for them. I was finally able to go back to college, only motivated by my desire to never go back. My grades were really good, straight A's for an entire year, but I hated every day. I went to class and slept when I wasn't in class because when I was asleep i wasn't sad. Not once did my parents ever say they were proud about my grades they cared so much about, or asked how I was feeling. \n\n\nI'm kinda rambling so I'll just cut this short and say I'm back again where I started. This last semester wasn't great for me and now they're pissed again that I didn't tell them. Well, my mom's happy I'm home because now she'll have a clean house. I just want out of this situation, and I don't plan on staying at my house no matter what they say because they don't have anything over me, except words. I've told my friends about my situation and they fully support me and want to help. They're people I love who love me back. You should never regret telling the ones you love anything, because they will love you and want to help you. Again, sorry this isn't concise but I've been meaning to get this off my chest. I hope this helps. "", '7': ""Okay, so at great risk of voicing an extremely unpopular opinion amongst depressed people and their subreddits, it's because you're making the decision to be depressed. \n\nPlease hear me out, as I'm speaking from lots of experience: I've been depressed my entire life. My mom died when I was 14 from HIV after wasting away for a decade. My dad was emotionally and physically abusive, and kicked me out of my house at 18. I stared on antidepressants around the same time, but used alcohol and other substances to cope. I've been institutionalized several times, and been at the point of suicide maybe two dozen times. My little brother died earlier this year from an overdose, and I just got out of a 10 year long-term dysfunctional relationship. I have every reason/excuse to be depressed and end it all. But, as I was sinking into yet another abyss of depression, I had an epiphany: I was allowing it to happen. \n\nIn a sick way, I liked being depressed: it was easy, I didn't have to fight for anything, I didn't have to feel anything, I could give up and mope in bed all day, and it was always everyone else's fault for how I felt. It was a total surrender of my life to doing nothing and letting everything happen to me. And yet I was very slowly getting tired of it. Sick and tired of being sick and tired, as the cliche goes. By finally realizing that it was a decision, I was immensely empowered, because that enabled me to decide **not** to be depressed.\n\nI know that sounds crazy, but I realized that I was using depression my entire life to hide from my pain, to give in, give up, and take the easiest path there is. Mostly because I didn't believe I deserved to be happy, partly because I didn't want to fight for it. I know it's an excruciating pain and sadness, some of the worst hurt that a human can experience, and you might say that it's not *easy* to hurt that much, but if you search deep within yourself and ask what you are getting from depression, you'll find that it's a means to an end. A way of giving in to everything: life, yourself, happiness, effort, caring... It all gets surrendered to nothingness.\n\nLook deep within yourself and ask what you want your life to be about, what your ideal life would look like. I'm not going to be delusional and say you could be an astronaut, but if you're brutally fucking honest with yourself, you'll realize that most of the limitations to having a much better life are self-imposed. Do you have toxic family members? Get them out of your life. Most people can't do this because of guilt and obligation, but you've got to look after yourself, and there's no point in living an absolutely miserable life for someone else. Sometimes you have to let go of some things to be able to hold on to other, better things. Whatever is holding you back, let it go.\n\nIt's really fucking hard to care about life, yourself, your happiness, and to put everything on the line by caring and trying. It's much, much easier to give in, I know. But you really can build the life you want, especially if you're not your own biggest obstacle like I was. I know it's hard, I know it's scary, but you have nothing to lose. You're already miserable and rotting away. I believe it's possible, and so must you. Try it, just for a day: reach down deep inside yourself, and truly **decide** that you are finally ready to be happy. You can be miserable because, or happy despite. It's your call. I know it's not easy, but everything in your life has to start from this one willful decision to be happy."", '8': ""I attempted to seek help 8 years ago, I was also told to do breathing exercises. Told him I already do. He said...do them better? I tried to make it clear that I'm not joking around about having a real, ongoing issue. A couple months of worthless copays later he finally decided to give me medication. It didn't work. I asked him to try something else, he just said...no. Then a while later when I was on my own trying to purchase insurance, I got denied based on my 'preexisting condition.' \n\nThat was the last time I attempted to seek help, now I'm watching some orange imbecile try to make it even harder for others like me to get help after that last guy actually tried to do something about it. What a fucking country this is. "", '9': ""Been this way as long as I can remember, still do. I would just love it if my existence would disappear. I honestly feel like I shouldn't have been born. I soon found out, even if my depression is a slow kill for me, I have to fight it. I have been battling with depression, since who knows how long. I'm 30 years old, and you would think suicide thoughts would fade once not a teen anymore. Unfortunately due to the abuse when I was a child, and how society is, I closed myself off to everyone. I have no friends, and hardly anyone to talk to about how I feel. \n\nStill, even then, my depression and suicide thoughts, I won't let it drag me down, as it always wanted to in my life. I know, even though I hate to admit it, I know there is a reason for all of this pain, to make me stronger and keep on moving forward, and live.\n\nFind your own strength. Even if you believe it's not there, it is, because as much as you wish you didn't, you do have a purpose in life. Everyone has a purpose, and one day you will see why, as time goes by. \n\nMy purpose for living, is my child. I was at the brick of seriously letting go of everything that life has thrown at me as stones, to finally getting one of my prayers, granted, and that is my purpose in life.\n\nYou have a purpose in life, everyone does. And when you find it, or when it comes to you, you'll know your reason in life.

I think I submitted over 1000 resumes over 3+ years of unemployment and got a mere handful of interviews.

I finally got one job that my parents forced me to apply to for 10 hours a week doing data entry that turned into nearly 6 years and promotion to the full time office manager. Someone just finally took a chance on me. I\'m so lucky for that. But yes, depression can make you paralyzed to find a job. And sometimes the lack of finding a job can really make you depressed.

I've been on SSRI's for like 15 years or so, so I just assumed that my last medication failed me. It wasn't until this past winter that I decided to get my testosterone levels tested for the first time. I've been a very dedicated lifter for almost 8 years so testosterone is important to me, and after I started reading about hypogonadism I felt like I fit the description perfectly. Only problem is that depression fits those symptoms perfectly as well. Regardless, the numbers came back much lower than expected. I was below the lab range with testosterone levels you would see in your average 85 year old man. I pursued some more thorough testing and eventually decided to start testosterone replacement therapy in April. I'm in Canada and I'm 27 years old so this was very difficult to do and cost alot of money as I had to do most of it privately. After several different doctors and endocrinologists, one doctor finally sent me for a CT scan and the answers to my low testosterone were finally revealed. I actually just got a prescription for testosterone yesterday. It was a huge battle being a young man with some muscle asking for steroids, but my family doctor went for it after I told her they found a tumor and the success I've had with testosterone replacement therapy.\n\nI'm not sure where I'll be going from here. I see a different endocrinologist in January and I'm waiting for an MRI, but currently the tumor is less than 10mm in diameter and it's not causing any vision issues. It's a prolactin secreting tumor but my prolactin is normal, so it seems to just be lowering my LH and FSH(LH and FSH are responsible for telling the testicles to produce testosterone). I haven't had my growth hormone tested however, so I'd like to get that done. TRT has been great, but I'm still not feeling as well as I did a few years ago.\n\nAnyways, that was long, but your situation was so similar to mine that I had to share a bit of my story. I've never heard of the cortisol drug, so that's very interesting. My cortisol appears to be normal, but normal and optimal are two very different things sometimes. Do you mind me asking what your cortisol was at? Are you on testosterone? What were the changes you noticed with growth hormone?""}",<b> You may want to take a look on these highly rated comments: </b>,click event

The past year and a half I've been doing a lot better, but recently it's back. Two weeks ago it was so bad I felt lost again and I decided to help myself instead of letting it go unnoticed. I told my closest friends and family. It was the hardest thing I've had to do in a long time but I did it. Different styles of conversation but same main point.

I've had depression for several years but it got SO much worse with some serious family drama that happened about 5-7 years ago. It was so bad I don't talk to half of my family anymore. I have times at work still where I want to break down and cry if I think about it too much or if its a bad day. I actually did break down and start crying one time in the bathroom and I'm not the kind of girl to bring makeup in my purse so it was just awkward.

I think I also have a hard time with actually being honest. I'm so used to putting on a brave face and being in denial of my severe depression because I have to do it so often I don't even realize I'm doing it in therapy. I'm not sure if that's helpful at all but I hope it is "", '2': 'I can relate to this. I was sexually abused by quite a few people in my life. First, my brother. I was around 7, he was 8. Then that grew into him and his friend Jack intimidating me with weapons to show them my body and let them touch me. I thought that was over, but when I was 11 I would wake up to my brother in my room, standing over me. This happened every so often for a few months.\n\nWe went to Disney World and one night, I woke up. I decided to pretend I was still sleeping. He was touching me all over and jerking off over me. He left the room eventually and I immediately told my stepmom. I remember her crying and hugging me, and me being in shock for the whole day, not speaking. Then we finally went to go eat at a restaurant that night and it all came out; I started sobbing and couldn\'t control myself.\n\nThe years after that were hard. I started showing my body to men online (even though I was 11, that continued for awhile, even into adulthood). I started self harming. I went from being a straight A student to failing everything and having no hope for life.\n\nIn high school I began using drugs and drinking alcohol. And smoking cigarettes. I pretty much took anything I could get my hands on. I was very emotionally unstable at this point, always had cuts on my arms that were visible at school, and would sleep underneath my desk in most of my classes. None of my teachers ever said anything to me. They never pressed the issue or asked if anything was wrong.\n\nMy first boyfriend at 16 was emotionally abusive and didn\'t respect my boundaries when we had sex. He belittled me in front of friends and called me a whore often, though he was cheating and I wasn\'t.\n\nThat ended and I dated another guy at 17-18. Heavy into drug use and severely suicidal and emotionally unstable, I was the turbulent one in this relationship. The volatile and angry one. He never touched me or hurt me at this point but he was emotionally distant and honestly didn\'t seem that into me. This made me become more reactive. I\'m not saying it was right for me to be that way though. But I still felt guilty. He didn\'t respect me much, but looking back I couldn\'t have respected him much either with the way I treated him.\n\nFor a little bit we had been trying anal. I couldn\'t really get into it much because it was painful to me, so I told him I didn\'t want to try anymore.\nBut one day we had sex and he forced himself into me anyways. I went into shock again this time and I just remember lying there, staring at the ground, limp like a rag doll, crying and saying no. But I don\'t think he heard me.\nAt least that\'s what he said.\n\nI was admitted into three different mental hospitals within a month for suicide attempts. FYI mental hospitals suck and you\'re not treated much like someone struggling, but more like a prisoner and someone that can\'t be trusted and is undeserving of empathy.\n\nIt\'s like that Stanford experiment from the 70s where they had participants sign up to either be a prisoner or prison guard and play out the parts. The experiment was ended early because the participants started being violent towards each other and took their roles too seriously, despite knowing that the experiment was staged.\nThat\'s how it is in mental hospitals. There\'s an us vs. them mentality that needs to be fixed.\n\nAnyways, my mom decided that we should move to Florida, because at this point I had pretty much lost my damn mind. I remember many days lost to my memory because of taking near-death amounts of Xanax and ending up in people\'s driveways, or the cops calling my mom to come pick me up. I don\'t remember this, but apparently I went to find my boyfriend at his friends house and started trying to fuck up his car (I didn\'t at all lol) and then calling out to him. Apparently I knocked on the next door neighbor\'s door and asked if they knew where he was. But unfortunately for me that neighbor happened to be a cop, home for the night from duty.\n\nMoving to Florida was not fun at first. I didn\'t have any connections for drugs anymore so I would go on dates just to get alcohol. I know it\'s terrible. My self-esteem and value for myself were so low. I even dated somebody because they had free Xanax, Adderall, cocaine, ketamine, weed, and acid to share with me.\n\nEventually I found natural herbs as supplements for these drugs and though I\'m addicted to one, it\'s way better than what I was doing before.\n\nMy life was gaining a feeling of purpose. I found waiting jobs at first and started making friends with people, due to this community of cafes in my area that all sell these herb alternatives. It\'s a really large community.\n\n I dated somebody who for the first time, wasn\'t abusive. It was a step up. We ended up breaking up because it was codependent as hell and he had no motivation or purpose in his life, but it was way better than before. \n\nI had done graphic design as a kid and by luck, had a yoga studio owner see my value and pay me to design though my experience was lacking due to years of not pursuing design. \n\nShe eventually let me go but has recommended me to both the jobs I had afterwards. A job at a local agency that way underpaid me (but was good experience). And my current job, doing freelance for a local branding expert who only works with clients who are actively trying to help people (like life coaches and the like). So now I do website development and content writing. And I get to write about spirituality and self-actualization.\n\nWhen I was 16 I had discovered Buddhism but didn\'t have the sanity or self control to instill the morals into my own life.\n\nNow I have all the tools for healing. I was diagnosed with complex PTSD two years ago. It took years of therapists as a kid telling me I was dramatic and manipulative for someone to finally see what I was suffering with. That it wasn\'t just GAD and depression. \n\nI don\'t feel like a lost cause anymore. I feel like my life has purpose. I\'m like you, I\'m still depressed. I find it hard to self-motivate pretty often and will let my chores and responsibilities slide (mostly chores lol). I have flashbacks every now and then and do disassociate still, but I\'m not waking up every day destroying myself anymore. I\'m healing and exploring new methods of healing. I\'m dating someone. My bar for acceptable relationships has grown from, ""he doesn\'t hurt me"" to, ""he makes me feel fulfilled and happy"". \n\nI can now calm myself down in my anger or sadness (not all the time). But I can rationalize with myself now. I never was able to before.\n\nI don\'t know why but your story inspired me to share with you. I feel like it was very sincere and heart felt. I\'ve only ever written down this full story in my own journal, never to anyone else. When I tell people, I don\'t go into the details. I figured out pretty quick that people don\'t wanna hear em usually.\n\nBut thank you to anyone that reads this. And maybe it can help others realize that living with trauma is not a hopeless death sentence. It can get better.\n\n', '3': ""Wow, so sorry for your loss that must have been so traumatic. Have you ever been treated for depression?\nMy depression stems from my childhood both of my parents are drug addicts so I've never had a family. So of course I grew up extremely poor and constantly changed schools never made any friends, didn't go to college until I was in my mid twenties so didn't make any lasting relationships there either. I've been a stripper for a while and I don't really have much in common with those women so no friends there either. I've managed to avoid any major damage from dancing no drug habits hooking etc but it's still very isolating. Aside from a string of bad relationships I've been alone my entire life. Twice in the last two years I thought I'd met someone who I liked and thought they felt the same way only to get tricked/rejected.I'm an honest person with pure intentions so I tend to be very naive and it always gets me hurt. I think I've finally learned after much heartache how to avoid abusive relationships. But it's like a cycle I cannot seem to do the things I need to do to improve myself and I think that there is no way anyone can love me the way I am. Who wants a stripper with drug addict parents. I'm almost done with my degree and I'm not even excited about that I'm not excited about anything. I honestly don't think anything will ever change it's a cycle I'm always going to be fucked up because of my depression. "", '4': ""I started to have depression when I was 7 due mostly to the abuse of my parents. I saw a therapist for about a year and it certainly helped but years down the line it became worse again.\n\nIt wasn't until I was 16 when I finally got the help I needed. My mother too finally got the idea she needed to treat me better, and has become nicer over the years.\n\nWith my break up 2 months ago tho, my ex really messed me up for a while and I am back in therapy and finally recovering and am stable again. I don't think I will stop going to therapy from now on. At least progressing to every 2 or 3 months as i get better.\n\nIf u suffer from depression, you need to see A therapist or your disease will eat you alive."", '5': 'Reading your post made me cry. I read your post and saw myself in every word. I too have been broken up with my boyfriend who i love dearly for the last month and a half. However unlike you and your boyfriend we have no self control. We still love each other very much and we talk daily. When we first decided to break up the decision was not my own, like you my boyfriend made the decision. He stated he wanted to make sure if this was really what we both wanted. Two days later he told me he couldn’t do this. Every week since then i tell him we need to stop or he tells me. I suffer from BPD and Bipolar disorder and have tried to kill my self a total of about a half a dozen times since our break up. He knows of two attempts. A few days ago being my last and most closest time. I hadn’t drank or eaten in 5 days i felt dizzy and knew my time was coming. But i wanted to see him. He forced me to eat and sat with my for 5 hours. But he told me we have to try to walk away for a little. I asked him will we ever go back to normal he said he doesn’t know. Being with my boyfriend was the happiest time in my life. Before him i was being verbally and mentally abused by my mother. I finally got my own place but could feel no happiness and decided to take my own life. Funny thing my boyfriend begged me to come out that day, i never thought i fall for him but he saved my life. This has been even more painful than my sexual assault combined. \nI know that was long but just to say this to you i know how it feels. To have someone who basically makes your life worth living leave. We may not truly understand this, and we may never go back to being in relationship. And that hurts very much. I can’t say what will happen to either of us from this point. I just want to let you know i hope your boyfriend is relieved of all his problems and he comes back to you. That is my hope for you. Love shouldn’t die because of someone’s outside fears, problems, and it misunderstandings. And from the looks of things he loves you very much. ', '6': ""I don't regret telling my friends but I hated having to tell my parents. I've had to do it a couple times because I wasn't doing well in college and I didn't tell them. Each time my dad was furious at me for not saying anything, and yet he didn't want to talk about it. Their response was to pull me out of college, lock me it the house, keep me away from friends who understood and cared, and then never talked to me about my depression or anxiety.  My dad would just glare and drop snide remarks about how I need to work harder and just push forward, but he offered no help. I was stuck at my house for about a year, and in that time all I did was get worse. My day was to wake up, clean the house, and go to sleep. I feel like they never wanted me to improve, they just wanted me under their control and work for them. I was finally able to go back to college, only motivated by my desire to never go back. My grades were really good, straight A's for an entire year, but I hated every day. I went to class and slept when I wasn't in class because when I was asleep i wasn't sad. Not once did my parents ever say they were proud about my grades they cared so much about, or asked how I was feeling. \n\n\nI'm kinda rambling so I'll just cut this short and say I'm back again where I started. This last semester wasn't great for me and now they're pissed again that I didn't tell them. Well, my mom's happy I'm home because now she'll have a clean house. I just want out of this situation, and I don't plan on staying at my house no matter what they say because they don't have anything over me, except words. I've told my friends about my situation and they fully support me and want to help. They're people I love who love me back. You should never regret telling the ones you love anything, because they will love you and want to help you. Again, sorry this isn't concise but I've been meaning to get this off my chest. I hope this helps. "", '7': ""Okay, so at great risk of voicing an extremely unpopular opinion amongst depressed people and their subreddits, it's because you're making the decision to be depressed. \n\nPlease hear me out, as I'm speaking from lots of experience: I've been depressed my entire life. My mom died when I was 14 from HIV after wasting away for a decade. My dad was emotionally and physically abusive, and kicked me out of my house at 18. I stared on antidepressants around the same time, but used alcohol and other substances to cope. I've been institutionalized several times, and been at the point of suicide maybe two dozen times. My little brother died earlier this year from an overdose, and I just got out of a 10 year long-term dysfunctional relationship. I have every reason/excuse to be depressed and end it all. But, as I was sinking into yet another abyss of depression, I had an epiphany: I was allowing it to happen. \n\nIn a sick way, I liked being depressed: it was easy, I didn't have to fight for anything, I didn't have to feel anything, I could give up and mope in bed all day, and it was always everyone else's fault for how I felt. It was a total surrender of my life to doing nothing and letting everything happen to me. And yet I was very slowly getting tired of it. Sick and tired of being sick and tired, as the cliche goes. By finally realizing that it was a decision, I was immensely empowered, because that enabled me to decide **not** to be depressed.\n\nI know that sounds crazy, but I realized that I was using depression my entire life to hide from my pain, to give in, give up, and take the easiest path there is. Mostly because I didn't believe I deserved to be happy, partly because I didn't want to fight for it. I know it's an excruciating pain and sadness, some of the worst hurt that a human can experience, and you might say that it's not *easy* to hurt that much, but if you search deep within yourself and ask what you are getting from depression, you'll find that it's a means to an end. A way of giving in to everything: life, yourself, happiness, effort, caring... It all gets surrendered to nothingness.\n\nLook deep within yourself and ask what you want your life to be about, what your ideal life would look like. I'm not going to be delusional and say you could be an astronaut, but if you're brutally fucking honest with yourself, you'll realize that most of the limitations to having a much better life are self-imposed. Do you have toxic family members? Get them out of your life. Most people can't do this because of guilt and obligation, but you've got to look after yourself, and there's no point in living an absolutely miserable life for someone else. Sometimes you have to let go of some things to be able to hold on to other, better things. Whatever is holding you back, let it go.\n\nIt's really fucking hard to care about life, yourself, your happiness, and to put everything on the line by caring and trying. It's much, much easier to give in, I know. But you really can build the life you want, especially if you're not your own biggest obstacle like I was. I know it's hard, I know it's scary, but you have nothing to lose. You're already miserable and rotting away. I believe it's possible, and so must you. Try it, just for a day: reach down deep inside yourself, and truly **decide** that you are finally ready to be happy. You can be miserable because, or happy despite. It's your call. I know it's not easy, but everything in your life has to start from this one willful decision to be happy."", '8': ""I attempted to seek help 8 years ago, I was also told to do breathing exercises.

I'm 30 years old, and you would think suicide thoughts would fade once not a teen anymore. Unfortunately due to the abuse when I was a child, and how society is, I closed myself off to everyone. I have no friends, and hardly anyone to talk to about how I feel. \n\nStill, even then, my depression and suicide thoughts, I won't let it drag me down, as it always wanted to in my life. I know, even though I hate to admit it, I know there is a reason for all of this pain, to make me stronger and keep on moving forward, and live.\n\nFind your own strength. Even if you believe it's not there, it is, because as much as you wish you didn't, you do have a purpose in life. Everyone has a purpose, and one day you will see why, as time goes by. \n\nMy purpose for living, is my child. I was at the brick of seriously letting go of everything that life has thrown at me as stones, to finally getting one of my prayers, granted, and that is my purpose in life.\n\nYou have a purpose in life, everyone does.

I am now the proud owner of a micro prolactinoma.\n\nI've been off work for over a year after quite the mental breakdown. I've been on SSRI's for like 15 years or so, so I just assumed that my last medication failed me. It wasn't until this past winter that I decided to get my testosterone levels tested for the first time. I've been a very dedicated lifter for almost 8 years so testosterone is important to me, and after I started reading about hypogonadism I felt like I fit the description perfectly. Only problem is that depression fits those symptoms perfectly as well. Regardless, the numbers came back much lower than expected. I was below the lab range with testosterone levels you would see in your average 85 year old man. I pursued some more thorough testing and eventually decided to start testosterone replacement therapy in April. I'm in Canada and I'm 27 years old so this was very difficult to do and cost alot of money as I had to do most of it privately. After several different doctors and endocrinologists, one doctor finally sent me for a CT scan and the answers to my low testosterone were finally revealed. I actually just got a prescription for testosterone yesterday. It was a huge battle being a young man with some muscle asking for steroids, but my family doctor went for it after I told her they found a tumor and the success I've had with testosterone replacement therapy.\n\nI'm not sure where I'll be going from here. I see a different endocrinologist in January and I'm waiting for an MRI, but currently the tumor is less than 10mm in diameter and it's not causing any vision issues. It's a prolactin secreting tumor but my prolactin is normal, so it seems to just be lowering my LH and FSH(LH and FSH are responsible for telling the testicles to produce testosterone). I haven't had my growth hormone tested however, so I'd like to get that done. TRT has been great, but I'm still not feeling as well as I did a few years ago.\n\nAnyways, that was long, but your situation was so similar to mine that I had to share a bit of my story. I've never heard of the cortisol drug, so that's very interesting. My cortisol appears to be normal, but normal and optimal are two very different things sometimes. Do you mind me asking what your cortisol was at? Are you on testosterone? What were the changes you noticed with growth hormone?""}",<b> I got some great relevant comments with highlighted words for you: </b>,click event:1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0

We have to find ways and you are still looking and far too young to call it quits. Do not give up yet.\n\nI know social anxiety is hard. The way we are exposed to stellar people is unbearable at times. Every minute we waste seems like we are becoming nothing. Life is not one size fits all. We will find courage in small steps.

I disagree that you have entered sudden relapse. I think you have had a sudden *lapse*. The difference is important you see, because we focus on the negatives. You've had a good few weeks, you're getting it done dude. Think of it like this, you have gone forward one step, another, another, another x20, oops back one step. You are still many steps ahead, this lapse does not undo *you*.  \n\nDoes it help to realise that there is a direct cause behind this fleeting lapse?

Maybe just start with making a list. Write down everything you have to do. Include things for pleasure like hanging out with friends and self-care. Break up big tasks into little ones. Write due dates down and organize by urgency and importance. It'll look scary, but that's ok. Write down your schedule and fit time to work on the tasks on your list. Remember to put down time for sleep and social activities.  Those are basic needs. Humans are social creatures. Maybe talk to a therapist if you can, lots of campuses in the US offer free counseling. If you don't get everything done on time, that's ok. You're a human. \n\nTalk to your professors in person if you can. Tell them you're overwhelmed and need some help. It might not help, but at very least you can say you tried. You can always drop a class to lighten the load.

I\'ve found myself crying in the bathroom or even at my desk if I have a moment there and I can\'t control it.  But i don\'t think the answer for me has been giving up completely.  Sometimes if you can get a break, a few minutes a day, or a vacation day, or even see a doctor to write you a note (they are masters at making it a confidential issue with their phrasing), it might be enough.  Personally, I find that I might feel like I\'m dying for the next day of unstructured time- but when I do get that my depression does a number on me and I feel worse.  I\'ve also taken leave from work for depression and hated that I needed to do that- but sometimes it\'s necessary and you can see if you can get disability for a short term absence.\n\nRight now I don\'t like being out of work for more than a day because I get worse.  I get lonely and sadder. Maybe that\'s just because I live alone, which is different I guess.\n\nI know it\'s hard to be in an environment where people are not understanding of your feelings and you are expected* to try and keep them hidden.  When you are depressed or anxious it\'s hard to be at work where people are expecting things from you and basically your needs are just no where on their radar.  I work with the public all day so I feel so drained sometimes putting on the work face.  \n\nWhat I\'ve learned is that sometimes there are moments in the day that make it a relief to actually be there than not, and sometimes work feels more like an escape now than a burden.

I don\'t know it all sounds so petty to say it like that.  But I\'m at one of the worst depressions of my life and if I have a day off I don\'t do the best things with it.

I’ve suffered with ADD, Depression, and anxiety since I was little. My parents noticed and took me in to see a psychiatrist when I was 13 years old but I would lie to avoid being put on medicine. In the end it back fired because at 20 years old I had a mental break down. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. I would say the same thing how can I feel like this when I am truly blessed and have an amazing life. Now I am on medicine and finally found the right one after three years of being a lab rat. What I am getting to is it’s okay to be depressed, one we live in a crazy world but two depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain. Medicine will help level everything out and it’s good to start now so you can learn how to train your brain so eventually you won’t need medicine. If your parents don’t believe you tell them to go online and look up chronic depression. I always say the mind is more powerful than we think, and mental illness is a CHRONIC disease. Robert Williams for example, we all thought he was happy when he suffered from the terrible thoughts of depression. So take a deep breath, write all your feelings down and then read it to your parents. The best way for them to understand the thoughts going through your head is by telling them sometimes you feel life would be better without you. Don’t be afraid to cry, let it all out people who don’t suffer from mental illness won’t ever  understand but it’s real and they’re are facts to prove it. Everything will be okay and once you tell your parents it will feel like ten pounds lifted off your shoulders.

One thing that i have found useful when starting to work with a new therapist, or even working long term is doing a check in with them. Asking them if you two can talk about what progress you or they are seeing--sometimes when we are in this funk of life, it get\'s hard to see the positives, the small baby steps that we are making towards recovery, towards getting better. \nWith therapy, sometimes we just need someone to listen--any good therapist will let you vent and then sometimes go back and ask more questions to get a better idea of what is going on. He or she will try to figure out a treatment plan that works for you (at least they should). Again, having conversations with your therapist, because it is a special kind of relationship, is really important and YOU are the one who is paying for the help. It may be scary to talk to them about this but yeah... And no, you don\'t need to ""get used to it.""

I'm 2 years out, but I guess some advice I could give is to just appreciate these times now. You'll never have anything like this again where you are seeing kids your age everyday and sitting in a classroom. The rest of your life won't be like that. It is hard to realize now. Looking back at my years of school, I probably thought everything was a bigger deal than it was. I only see people from high school probably a couple times a year if I run into them somewhere. But yes, I was a very quiet one as well. People like to remind you of that, but there is nothing wrong with it. \nSo I guess what I'm saying is to just make sure you get all your stuff done, studies and homework or sports if you do any and appreciate being your age because you only go to high school once"", '14': ""Some people are probably going to resent me for saying it, but you sound like me before I treated weed like a medicine rather than a recreation.  Now that's not a solution or even a piece of the puzzle for a lot people, but it is for me.  It reminds me that there's good in the world and that I want to engage in it and be a part of it.  \n\nI have ADHD and Generalized Anxiety disorder and Major Depressive Disorder, the three are a trifecta that feed on each other like Cerberus.  And they grow when you try to run from them.  But sometimes you have to, even if you have that knowledge, which you might forget when Cerberus comes at you in a different form than you're used to.  \n\nJust remember man, any change, even a good one is a stressor.  Look up that list that assigns numerical values to stressful life events.  Even getting a raise is a bit stressful.  \n\nYou're not a fool for reaching out dude, that's the most quintessential human action you can have.  Let me tell you a fragment of a story.  I once worked at a nursing home and until it suddenly happened to me, I didn't know it was a thing.  You see, when people are dying and they're really on their way out some part of them knows even if they're fucking gone already. They will reach out and grab your hand. They want to hold your hand and they just need that human connection, it's visceral at that point. This is what makes us human.  Vulnerability is what makes us human.  It is okay to be vulnerable, you must just find the right people to do it with.  There are cannibals and there are predators but there are lovers and fighters and weepers out there, too.  \n\nThe thing about real depression is that some things can be counter intuitive and a lot of advice you'd get from society will be total bunk when it comes to actually dealing with it in any genuine way.  \n\nFor me, and again this may not be for everyone (always listen to your gut, trust it), but for me I have to go into the gaping maw if I want to ever get to the bottom of it.  And sometimes you don't.  Sometimes you just float, stuck there. You wish you could cry but you won't, you can't. You're stuck in the moment a quarter second before you would usually start crying, replaying a combination in your head of things you've done wrong and reasons you don't deserve better treatment. These are thoughts you have to deal with but not just by telling them off or acknowledging that they're irrational. They are rational, for their own context. Which isn't reason as much as the mind and ourselves and what we need to thrive.  \n\nNow if we take a corny concept like a potted plant and some soil you'd say you need water and sunlight.  You need things to happen for you to be able to thrive, and that's going to be hard with what you have. The research is out there that will show you people with ADHD get their lives started later. They do everything later. And they're late for everything. What the research doesn't get into is why. That's personal. You have to figure out what your internal dynamic and landscape is like, but there are some pretty good methods people have massaged into art and messages and music.  You just need to find one solid coping mechanism that works for you and it will get easier. \n\nDon't expect to solve everything or really, even anything right now.  We don't have the answers, we won't have the answers. We will work towards something and if we're dedicated it might pay off, or we might not be dedicated enough. That's okay. You're not a bad person because you're deficient at being a barber. It's not for everyone. Just because you once thought something made you happy, doesn't mean that formula is going to work 8 years from now. It's okay, have faith in the process. Your process. Find out the common denominators in the things you like, and start connecting the dots. I promise you'll find something you never expected to get joy from in the future, time and time again. Though we are tortured in some ways you'll find there's some hidden things we get that nobody else does. That hyperfocus, or whatever it's labelled as, that's out ability to dissect something in reverence of its intricacy. We fall in love with intricacy and details and get totally and unrepentantly lost in them.  We go down rabbit holes most people only glimpse. \n\nGive yourself some time.  Give yourself a little self-care. Treat your future self as a buddy you want to do good things for, but know you won't always have the money or ability to go out with. That buddy is happy whether they see you 6 months from now, 3 years from now, or 2 days from now. The rest of that time you might thinking you're being a shitty friend, but you're not, man. You're just being you, and that's okay with them. \n\nJust find one thing to make it easier. You don't need to figure it out soon. Take the deadlines off, take off the expectations. They will drown people like us. \n\nMy advice, smoke some weed and find some music you totally forgot made you feel the equivalent of a religious experience.  You need those kind breaks to yourself. Your future self will thank you, too.  Even if he's not diversifying his portfolio while he does it."", '15': ""My opinion is that it could be beneficial to have suffered from it yourself. Of course the more middle-of-the-road option would be that you get as much treatment as possible and certainly work on improving your own well being as much as you can. No I don't think I'd want a counselor who knew they were depressed at 19 and didn't do anything about it, but instead decided to help others. Nor would I want a counselor who has no idea what the struggle is like. But someone who fought the battle and helped themselves would be great. \n\nI've probably been sitting here for two hours now if not more responding to every post I can find on the New tab, so I get what you mean about helping others. I'm a 30 year old mess and yet somehow I feel like I can reply to certain posts and maybe have a somewhat good reply. Maybe that's wrong, or maybe people wouldn't want my advice if they knew what my life was like. I don't know, but it sure is easier to think about someone else's situation because you remove the emotion of being the person who's actually tangled up in it. And if I did half the shit I tell other people, I probably could help myself, but I apparently just don't care. It sounds so uncomfortable to say because I do not think anything positive about myself, but sometimes as I write long ass replies on here and hope that maybe I said something decent, I've wondered if I couldn't be a counselor or something too. To my brain that sounds so arrogant and ridiculous that I would even say that, and I'm sure it'll never happen. \n\nAnyways, yes, if you can pull from the experience of your own story, I think that would only make you more effective. But you'd want your life to be in a better place too, not someone who goes home at the end of the day and struggles with depression. If you weren't in a better place, I think listening to other people and helping very well could drain you more or make you feel even worse.

Fatigue and exhaustion have always been my primary symptoms...the sadness is a byproduct of feeling so tired all the time.  Stimulants really help with that.

You are doing better, you said it yourself, don't forget this because it is the more important detail. We have bad days, this is unavoidable, but I would like to suggest a correction. I disagree that you have entered sudden relapse. I think you have had a sudden *lapse*. The difference is important you see, because we focus on the negatives. You've had a good few weeks, you're getting it done dude. Think of it like this, you have gone forward one step, another, another, another x20, oops back one step. You are still many steps ahead, this lapse does not undo *you*.  \n\nDoes it help to realise that there is a direct cause behind this fleeting lapse? You stayed up late to do work (which you deserve kudos for, good on you for working hard dude), and didn't sleep well, and this gave you a bad start on today.

And she said she was having a bad day, and she didn't go to her lectures. She was doing an adult colouring book and I was doing something else, and we talked and I told her that it is ok, because sometimes you just need a day.

Write due dates down and organize by urgency and importance. It'll look scary, but that's ok. Write down your schedule and fit time to work on the tasks on your list. Remember to put down time for sleep and social activities.  Those are basic needs. Humans are social creatures. Maybe talk to a therapist if you can, lots of campuses in the US offer free counseling. If you don't get everything done on time, that's ok. You're a human. \n\nTalk to your professors in person if you can. Tell them you're overwhelmed and need some help. It might not help, but at very least you can say you tried. You can always drop a class to lighten the load.

I\'ve found myself crying in the bathroom or even at my desk if I have a moment there and I can\'t control it.  But i don\'t think the answer for me has been giving up completely.  Sometimes if you can get a break, a few minutes a day, or a vacation day, or even see a doctor to write you a note (they are masters at making it a confidential issue with their phrasing), it might be enough.  Personally, I find that I might feel like I\'m dying for the next day of unstructured time- but when I do get that my depression does a number on me and I feel worse.  I\'ve also taken leave from work for depression and hated that I needed to do that- but sometimes it\'s necessary and you can see if you can get disability for a short term absence.\n\nRight now I don\'t like being out of work for more than a day because I get worse.

I’ve suffered with ADD, Depression, and anxiety since I was little. My parents noticed and took me in to see a psychiatrist when I was 13 years old but I would lie to avoid being put on medicine.

What I am getting to is it’s okay to be depressed, one we live in a crazy world but two depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain. Medicine will help level everything out and it’s good to start now so you can learn how to train your brain so eventually you won’t need medicine. If your parents don’t believe you tell them to go online and look up chronic depression. I always say the mind is more powerful than we think, and mental illness is a CHRONIC disease. Robert Williams for example, we all thought he was happy when he suffered from the terrible thoughts of depression. So take a deep breath, write all your feelings down and then read it to your parents. The best way for them to understand the thoughts going through your head is by telling them sometimes you feel life would be better without you. Don’t be afraid to cry, let it all out people who don’t suffer from mental illness won’t ever  understand but it’s real and they’re are facts to prove it.

One thing that i have found useful when starting to work with a new therapist, or even working long term is doing a check in with them. Asking them if you two can talk about what progress you or they are seeing--sometimes when we are in this funk of life, it get\'s hard to see the positives, the small baby steps that we are making towards recovery, towards getting better. \nWith therapy, sometimes we just need someone to listen--any good therapist will let you vent and then sometimes go back and ask more questions to get a better idea of what is going on. He or she will try to figure out a treatment plan that works for you (at least they should). Again, having conversations with your therapist, because it is a special kind of relationship, is really important and YOU are the one who is paying for the help.

I once worked at a nursing home and until it suddenly happened to me, I didn't know it was a thing.  You see, when people are dying and they're really on their way out some part of them knows even if they're fucking gone already. They will reach out and grab your hand. They want to hold your hand and they just need that human connection, it's visceral at that point. This is what makes us human.  Vulnerability is what makes us human.  It is okay to be vulnerable, you must just find the right people to do it with.  There are cannibals and there are predators but there are lovers and fighters and weepers out there, too.  \n\nThe thing about real depression is that some things can be counter intuitive and a lot of advice you'd get from society will be total bunk when it comes to actually dealing with it in any genuine way.  \n\nFor me, and again this may not be for everyone (always listen to your gut, trust it), but for me I have to go into the gaping maw if I want to ever get to the bottom of it.  And sometimes you don't.  Sometimes you just float, stuck there. You wish you could cry but you won't, you can't. You're stuck in the moment a quarter second before you would usually start crying, replaying a combination in your head of things you've done wrong and reasons you don't deserve better treatment. These are thoughts you have to deal with but not just by telling them off or acknowledging that they're irrational. They are rational, for their own context. Which isn't reason as much as the mind and ourselves and what we need to thrive.  \n\nNow if we take a corny concept like a potted plant and some soil you'd say you need water and sunlight.  You need things to happen for you to be able to thrive, and that's going to be hard with what you have. The research is out there that will show you people with ADHD get their lives started later. They do everything later. And they're late for everything. What the research doesn't get into is why. That's personal. You have to figure out what your internal dynamic and landscape is like, but there are some pretty good methods people have massaged into art and messages and music.  You just need to find one solid coping mechanism that works for you and it will get easier. \n\nDon't expect to solve everything or really, even anything right now.  We don't have the answers, we won't have the answers. We will work towards something and if we're dedicated it might pay off, or we might not be dedicated enough. That's okay. You're not a bad person because you're deficient at being a barber. It's not for everyone. Just because you once thought something made you happy, doesn't mean that formula is going to work 8 years from now. It's okay, have faith in the process. Your process. Find out the common denominators in the things you like, and start connecting the dots. I promise you'll find something you never expected to get joy from in the future, time and time again. Though we are tortured in some ways you'll find there's some hidden things we get that nobody else does. That hyperfocus, or whatever it's labelled as, that's out ability to dissect something in reverence of its intricacy. We fall in love with intricacy and details and get totally and unrepentantly lost in them.  We go down rabbit holes most people only glimpse. \n\nGive yourself some time.  Give yourself a little self-care. Treat your future self as a buddy you want to do good things for, but know you won't always have the money or ability to go out with. That buddy is happy whether they see you 6 months from now, 3 years from now, or 2 days from now. The rest of that time you might thinking you're being a shitty friend, but you're not, man. You're just being you, and that's okay with them. \n\nJust find one thing to make it easier. You don't need to figure it out soon. Take the deadlines off, take off the expectations. They will drown people like us. \n\nMy advice, smoke some weed and find some music you totally forgot made you feel the equivalent of a religious experience.  You need those kind breaks to yourself. Your future self will thank you, too.  Even if he's not diversifying his portfolio while he does it."", '15': ""My opinion is that it could be beneficial to have suffered from it yourself. Of course the more middle-of-the-road option would be that you get as much treatment as possible and certainly work on improving your own well being as much as you can. No I don't think I'd want a counselor who knew they were depressed at 19 and didn't do anything about it, but instead decided to help others. Nor would I want a counselor who has no idea what the struggle is like. But someone who fought the battle and helped themselves would be great. \n\nI've probably been sitting here for two hours now if not more responding to every post I can find on the New tab, so I get what you mean about helping others. I'm a 30 year old mess and yet somehow I feel like I can reply to certain posts and maybe have a somewhat good reply. Maybe that's wrong, or maybe people wouldn't want my advice if they knew what my life was like. I don't know, but it sure is easier to think about someone else's situation because you remove the emotion of being the person who's actually tangled up in it. And if I did half the shit I tell other people, I probably could help myself, but I apparently just don't care. It sounds so uncomfortable to say because I do not think anything positive about myself, but sometimes as I write long ass replies on here and hope that maybe I said something decent, I've wondered if I couldn't be a counselor or something too. To my brain that sounds so arrogant and ridiculous that I would even say that, and I'm sure it'll never happen. \n\nAnyways, yes, if you can pull from the experience of your own story, I think that would only make you more effective. But you'd want your life to be in a better place too, not someone who goes home at the end of the day and struggles with depression. If you weren't in a better place, I think listening to other people and helping very well could drain you more or make you feel even worse. "", '16': 'I once read: ""You are not good enough to get frustrated, you are bad enough to keep trying.""  \n\n\nMy friend, you are 20. Your life is a blank piece of paper waiting to be writen. You probably feel like garbage now, but this existential crisis is very good for you. You are questioning yourself and this is something that all of us will eventualy do or have allready done. Asking yourself towards your direction at your twenties will make the path easier for you because you will have figured yourself a little bit more which, I think, is paramount in order to live a wholesome life.   \n\n\nYeah, there are other guys at your age that make a lot more of money. Good for them. This does not mean that you cannot make a decent amount of money in five years, or in ten.   \n\n\nYour life is beginning, you have just reached the age in which people start doing things for their own, and not for anybody else.   \n\n\nFind what makes you happy. Take time to find that out and then, go for it. It\'s easier said than done, but it\'s the only way of getting things done. It get\'s easier.  Everyday, it gets a little easier.  But you gotta do it everyday, that\'s the hard part. But it does get easier. ', '17': ""Same.  Fatigue and exhaustion have always been my primary symptoms...the sadness is a byproduct of feeling so tired all the time.  Stimulants really help with that.  I still haven't gotten a prescription but plan to soon.  Been self-medicating for 16 years now with various stims.  Not suggesting you do this, OP.  Just sharing what has worked for me.  \n\nIf you're not actually tired but just feel like everything is pointless, you will probably get more out of simply going through the motions and forcing yourself to get up than by taking a stimulant.  Sometimes the 'fake it til you make it' approach really does work.  The body leads and the mind/heart follows.  Easier said than done, I know.  Baby steps and short-term goals should help you get there.  Start with sitting one day, then standing the next, then taking a shower, then going for a walk, etc.  ""}",<b> I found some good comments with highlighted words that could help you reflect: </b>,click event:1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
