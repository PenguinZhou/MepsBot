0,1578470655.8475134,"Achievements in frontier research is more important than good performance in courses, in my opinion. I have tried some research fields, but finally none of them became my interest. Now I am trying something new, so far, I don’t have that kind of disgusting feeling, but I am not sure whether it is my love. Everyone around me told that you need to have pure love, you need to be really interested in some area, otherwise your motivation is not strong. But the question is I still have no idea about what type of feeling is true interest. I was also suspicious that whether I am just escaping from something since I lost interest in almost everything you have tried. Sorry if I brought you down. I just needed to put it out there. I'm tired of being asked what my goals are in life and what I want. I hate the feeling of working hard every day like a robot but seems to be aimless efforts. Has anyone else felt like this? How did you find your interested area? How did you establish your life goal?

Where are you in your life at the moment? In terms of age, job, financial position, weight? \n\nI\'m 28 and going through a major existential crises of complete confusion and despair. Most of my day is spent trying to bat of any feeling of deep insecurity. But strangely that has translated into only enjoying conversation with strangers. Although, they rarely happen as I developed anxiety. But when they do, I actually do enjoy them, after the initial feeling of ""fuck someone who is talking to me"". I don\'t have any friends, never been great at managing relationships anyway but over the last 2 years, I\'m just ashamed of who I am so it\'s much better to speak to strangers who don\'t know you, then those who have this image of who you used to be.  I used to love going out, meeting people being social. Now not so much. I find myself not amused by anything really. In the same way you do. For me it\'s again because I\'ve stacked up at 0 in my career, financially and in personal development. I\'m sure if those areas were recharged and replenished I would start enjoying life a bit more but at the moment it\'s all pretty much the same. Sub par mood, with continuous feelings of hate for who I\'ve become. Pretty awesome right. \n\nStupid question but how open are you creatively? Do you, maybe not now, but in the past, try new things? Whether it be hobbies or parts of life you never even thought about? I am super open and always have been. So for me, I\'ve tried this and unfortunately doesn\'t work consistently but I pick up a book or watch a doc or go to an exhibition about something I know nothing about. Like I said unfortunetly it hasn\'t worked for me in any sifnicant and meaningful way but sometimes I do get absorbed by a new topic area. I literally paid zero attention to politics and sociology, but recently find myself reading and watching a lot of content on things like ""left vs right"" or ""class structures"" or reasons for inequality. ', '1': ""I miswrote that on accident actually. For a couple weeks I've fixed in my mind to do it tomorrow on Sunday at a specific time, I don't know why I wrote tomorrow last night. \n\nDo I want to live? Yes. Define living though. In my opinion living is only really living if you have the color of emotions in your life which I lost many years ago. Something which is impossible to regain. Find a hobby and enjoy it? Sure, the second half of that is where the real trouble comes though. I can't physically enjoy it, regardless of how interesting or fun it seems like it should be to me. Take in nature? I do think nature is very beautiful. I can't physically enjoy being in it though.\n\nI'm not sure if you can comprehend this concept if you haven't lost your emotions. I took them for granted. There is actually emotion attached to everything, you always feel it wherever you are and I distinctly remember it even though I only remember feeling it in elementary school. It really colors your life. But now that I've lost the ability to feel emotion? I can't feel a damn thing. Take for instance a couple weeks ago. Went on a date with this beautiful girl and we held hands and danced. But I felt nothing. And I remember what love felt like, it was extremely powerful. I felt like I should love this girl for a multitude of reasons but I just didn't *feel* it. Dancing with her should've been special, but emotionally it felt the same as doing any other mundane thing in life like taking out the trash or working. I'm so numb nothing feels different. For this reason I can't enjoy anything I used to, not hobbies, not being with friends, not anything at all. I felt more joy years ago when my life was shit than I do now. \n\nAgain I'm not sure you or anyone else can comprehend this without feeling it for yourself. Take it from me though, life is colorless without emotion and everything is the same dull grey regardless of what it is. I cannot physically enjoy anything. There is no joy to be had. Life pales in comparison to what it used to be, and guess what? It used to be a lot shittier just a few years ago, but at least I had emotions.  At least I could have fun doing things. What used to interest me like videogames or drawing which I could do for hours on end, now I can only do for ten minutes max and it's fucking hard to get myself to do it, as if it's some sort of chore. "", '2': 'I tried to analyze your text, and commenting on some things. Check it out if you want \\^\\^\n\nIf we would sum the text up, you could say that the deciding factors which kept you in this pessimistic and downleading spiral, were:\n\n1. Fighting the depression *alone.*\n\nThis is something that I have reflected upon as well. Having this burden of feeling of not being enough to anyone, or that you do not get any acknowledgement, is just horrible. It is downright depressing being the guy that compares his life with others. Because, no matter how you compare yourself with anyone else, I have learned that you ALWAYS LOSE. For me at least, because I compare my bad sides with everyone elses\' good. \n\n2. There was a lack of hobbies / interests\n\nNow, this for me is a difficult question because I am having a hard time finding things that amuse me. Note that I am not depressed, but I have very few real interests that lets my passion burn for what it is. And, honestly I do not know how to deal with this. It\'s just hard. Really, but as long as we strive for something better, I can just hope that we find something that fulfills us one day.\n\n3. Lack of purpose\n\nI think the crucial factor here to why we lack purpose, is that our society is built upon materialistic needs. We work, to buy. To consume, and to sleep. We lack the culture of Eastern civilization, aka, spirituality. Now, if you are an athiest, then you can take this with a grain of salt since depression does not work well with religion. Been there, done that, after all. But I believe finding meaning from within you, like trying to find hobbies and people to share your life with, is what will give you purpose. Maybe not directly, but with time, it could turn out to become a ""fake it till you make it"" solution. It is the root of depression that we want to get rid of right, and you obviously already have started to work with yourself. Yet, **and you should remember this:** you might have self reflected your whole life, but if you only Q and A yourself, then a lot of good theorizing might become lost. \n\nAlso even if you are in the darkest depths of hell where darkness suffocates you, there is a small light and the light can only be found in two things: You. *Or,* someone else. Peace and love. Jaaam', '3': 'I have the same situation and every day I think what can I do to improve it.\n\nI think the biggest reason for being ""boring"" is lack of confidence and lack of communication skills.\n\nI didn\'t do it yet but I\'m planning on taking a communication course to improve my overall skills because I was always somewhat shy and basically not a very talkative person.\n\nI think that will automatically improve my confidence but I\'ll try working on it even more with other things, like working out, going out more, try and get into ""awkward"" conversations and try to just deal with it instead of ""running away"". Like everything else, I should get better at it with time.\n\nAnother thing that I think is a reason for being boring is that we don\'t have a lot of interest for anything so we don\'t really have much to talk about. Find something that actually interests you and just read more about it, find people with the same interests and share opinions, although I still think the main two reasons are confidence and communication skills because I for example am a big fan of sport, but even when I talk about sport with others, I have a feeling that the other person doesn\'t have a lot of interest in what I\'m saying. \n\nAppearance, how you deliver the message is most important, and we\'re maybe not good at it right now, but we can get good at it, we just need to want it :)', '4': 'It\'s ok bro, I did not start working until I was 21 in last November. I\'m about to turn 22 now. I am still working on my GED, almost done right now once I finish the geometry chapter. I feel you. 19 is nothing, 21 is though lol. I get what you mean by:\n\n&gt; but the adult world just seems so far fetched and advanced\n\nIt\'s not. Everyone is a bunch of big children trying to present an image of something higher. There is no higher. We are children inside forever. People don\'t give a fuck, we are all in this weird crazy game and confused. Things go smooth and natural because of that. Nothing to be scared of.\n\n&gt;I am having a problem with what kind of job I’d like to get\n\nStop thinking about it from this stressful perspective. To do that, get any job you can; apply for a supermarket or whatever. Basically any job will give you real world experience and a more complete understanding of life, and then you can think more realistically when you get a deeper understanding of the value of time etc.\n\n&gt;but at the same time you want to enjoy what you’re doing right?\n\nThis is an excuse. You should instead think like so: ""I will probably enjoy any job that comes to me."" -- I push supermarket carts for a living, it\'s bad for my back and the pay is shit of course, but it\'s a very enjoyable job for me. Everyone tells me they hate that or it sounds shit. People love to be haters, but being a hater is childish &amp; inferior to acceptance of what you have. And hey, I may not be known for superficial things like creating a fuckin\' movie and making $2 billion, but I\'m known for being a really great hearted kind cool person, what really matters.\n\nMy advice is stop giving so much of a shit. That\'s good that you want to get a job that serves importance to the world -- but so what? The vast majority of people, intelligent or not, are forced to work shitty jobs before they can do what they want to do. I think if you just get a shitty job and start small from there, your mind will be clearer.', '5': 'I am actually glad that you posted this, because I feel the same way and I have never been able to express this to anyone or make anyone understand. When my depression got to it\'s worst point, this was what I thought about constantly- I couldn\'t be without something to occupy my mind because this is where my thoughts would drift and I would get terrified and feel like my head was spinning and feel nauseous. There were a million other problems I had/have due to my depression but this is probably the worst. It made it harder that everyone I have met, or communicated with who has depression doesn\'t fear death and doesn\'t obsess over the fear of death but rather wants to die/commit suicide etc. \nI will always say that I am a huge supporter of medication for depression for those who need it. It took me a couple of tries on meds, it\'s not the most fun process, but when I finally landed on the one that worked for me (wellbutrin), I noticed within weeks that the obsession over these thoughts diminished significantly. I was able to focus on my life because I wasn\'t constantly haunted with the thoughts. This was amazing to me because having the thoughts only contributes to the cycle of being depressed. \nI still have the moments, in the shower or laying in bed before falling asleep where I think about how everyone who is old always says ""life goes so fast,"" and it does go faster the more time goes on. I\'m terrified of aging because I know that it brings me closer to death. I dread the thought that one day I will be old and just awaiting my death, and I can\'t go back, can\'t change a thing, can\'t buy more time. \nPeople always say that you matter to others, and you\'ve made impacts in others lives, or that they needed you. That\'s true, and I am thankful that I have been there for those who needed me. It\'s hard to explain, but I still don\'t find that helpful at all because I think about how that only matters because we exist in the first place. If none of us existed it wouldn\'t matter at all. If those people hadn\'t been born it wouldn\'t matter at all. We exist solely to keep the race existing which feels meaningless to me. I often feel anger because we are living in a cruel world and I often resent the fact that I/humans were given a brain so capable of emotion, such deep thought, feeling so deeply, such a longing for meaning yet in the end we are never granted that (besides through religion, which doesn\'t work for me). \nThe thought of ceasing to exist in itself also terrifies me, the thought of not being, of not seeing what happens to the world, of simply turning to dust and hundreds of years later never being remembered. Even if souls remain and spirits exist, I fear watching years from a distance unable to speak with or touch my loved ones. Years and years in the future, the earth will be gone along with me and everything we ever did as humans here will no longer matter. \nI also wish many times that I was never born so I never had to feel these things. I refuse to have children for these reasons. I refuse to pass the depression and these feelings on to another human being, I wouldn\'t wish it upon anyone. That to me would be one of the most cruel things I could do. But I also refuse to have children because I feel that you spend your life getting attached to people who will eventually die. If nothing else takes you first, you have some good years. Then your grandparents or relatives die, your parents die, then your siblings may die before you. Whoever doesn\'t die before you is left with the sadness of losing you. So many people are obsessed with focusing their whole life on their career, years and years of education (Sometimes this makes people happy, education can make you happy, and that is awesome- I don\'t mean to put this down in all circumstances but many who go to college hate it- myself included). They waste their lives away, stressed out about work and money, only to make it to being old and now all your good years are gone. \nWhat I have gained that is positive from these thoughts is realizing that I should do what makes me happy because the time I have is short. When I am laying in my death bed I don\'t want to be thinking about what I should\'ve done, or shouldn\'t have, or how I should\'ve focused on the people I loved. Fuck what everyone else tells me I need to do to be happy- I don\'t need to have kids, I don\'t need to have a wildly successful career. If you\'re genuinely happy working at a grocery store and it pays your bills honestly who the fuck cares if everyone else is saying ""oh, that\'s not a career, that\'s not right, you should be somewhere else."" Never listen to anyone who says ""When I was your age I had x or y by now!"" It\'s a whole different playing field for this generation. I seek jobs and work that make me happy, or, at least, don\'t make me miserable. I refuse to stay in a job where I am miserable. I worked hard to get my credit to a good score so that I could take a vacation to Hawaii at 23 years old, and pay it off over a few months. Do whatever you can to do the things that make you happy while you are young. Traveling or whatever else makes you happy will be more difficult when you are old (When it\'s hard to walk, when you have tons of medications or who knows what else; a need for insulin, an oxygen tank). \nHopefully sharing how I feel didn\'t make you more depressed, I suppose the points I wanted to make are that there is no shame in medication or counseling. Don\'t let people who have never had depression try to tell you anything about it, how to fix it, or that it\'s invalid. Don\'t let them try and tell you things about medication, because at the end of the day, sure there are terrible problems with the pharmaceutical industry but antidepressants save lives in more ways than one. I highly recommend studying the psychology of depression/ how dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine etc. work. It helps you gain a great understanding that you are sick (just like someone with any other disease) and your brain doesn\'t work like other peoples instead of feeling ridiculous and invalid. And lastly, use every moment you have wisely, really do the things that make you happy. Don\'t let yourself be walked all over. Figure out how to realistically achieve your goals/happiness, because simply hearing ""life is great, you can do anything if you put your mind to it, this guy went from nothing to a millionaire so you can too!"" Doesn\'t help you feel motivated when you have depression at all. \nI wish you the best, you aren\'t alone!', '6': ""I'm going to repeat what other people have said and tell you that my relationship with my therapist is more important to me than the type. I've 'shopped around' for therapists before, because if I didn't feel a certain amount of security and trust, it just wasn't going to work. I usually give it around 3 meetings before I bail (if I feel like finding someone else), just in case one of us was having a bad day.\n\nI'm doing DBT right now, with isn't too different from CBT in a lot of ways. I'm supposed to practice different skills to help adjust my want of thinking. Making goal lists, finding ways to cope with emotional emergencies, tracking how often I feel like killing myself, that kind of thing. It's kind of tough but I actually found apps that help. The more personal stuff is kind of like pulling apart why I might feel a certain way so I can try to get past it. Even then, sometimes it ends up more important to find out what exactly I'm thinking or feeling than the older whys and stuff. I say 'I don't know' a lot, and I really like my therapist because she's okay with that answer and helps me pinpoint a more discerning reply. I find it insightful and helpful.\n\nI'd say most of the different therapies and therapists I've tried generally start out with almost an interview process, where you try to figure out if everything is a good fit. Like, if your wants and needs and goals line up with what that person offers. I've flat out left and never gone back when one therapist tried to tell me that I didn't want to get better hard enough. That was a bunch of shit and I never looked back. We obviously had different approaches. Lots of therapists will also try to get an assessment of how you feel and certain behavioral patterns because they'll want a formal evaluation. It's not unusual, although some of the questions might be interpreted as personal? Like if you take drugs, or how much you smoke or drink, have you ever been sexually assaulted, etc. But other stuff like how often you sleep or eat, if you've lost or gained weight, how you feel about crowds. Being honest about it all is important, since that's how they'll both diagnose and start tailoring treatment for you.\n\nCBT and DBT might be up your alley. I like things a little more personal and DBT doesn't give me too much of that, but my therapist as an individual does so it works out. Again, compatibility."", '7': 'Hi there. First of all I am sorry to hear that you\'re going through a depression and taking medication. While I have experienced depression, I\'m happy to finally be able to get through it in the end. Here are some observations I found about myself during that time:\n\n1. The reason for my depression is because I feel victimized: At the time I suddenly felt my parents were not people I actually respected. My long lost love ended up with another guy while I was still dreaming of her every night, so what\'s the use of all the connections we once had? Well I realized this was the problem. First of all whatever happened in the past doesn\'t really matter. My expectations that I put on some other person should\'t make me entitled to be victimized. After all, these are just other human beings who do what makes them happy. If someone left you and did not come back its because you couldn\'t make them happy. Now the option is learn from it and change (you could still be together in the future) or feel victimized. \n2. The reason for my depression is I don\'t have friends that I can stick with: During this time I was in college and most of my high school friends were somewhere else. I tried to tell them about my depression and they could\'t really say anything to help. First of all if they are far away you can\'t always count on them. Don\'t expect them to. It doesn\'t mean they are not nice some are just not that interested in those things. That\'s what I learned. Moreover, it was also because I was scared to open up to anyone. So where can you find people who can start being friends with? best places would be either joining a volunteer organization, join a church group, or find any self-enriching clubs around you, You are bound to find new friends there. But that\'s not enough. You need to start thinking this way ""I am young and have so many years in front of me. I am not have 23 years of my life back but I want to live the next years from now on with happiness and fulfillment"" So you take that leap. Away from your past and let the experiences in the next years define you. Be friends. Experience nature. Experience love once more. Find a career that makes you fulfilled. Don\'t settle for depression.\n\n3. The reason for my depression is because of I am thinking about myself: At the end of the day you realize you are breathing, you can still eat, you can still walk and you can still drink alcohol without any consequences to your body. You have access to internet! You have access to people. You still have the ability to move town (Well if you\'re strapped for cash I guess begin by saving up first then go). The possibilities for you is close to endless. But remember there are those who can\'t even do that. There are people who are suffering worst than you and they need physical help. They need you start thinking of solutions for them. There are people who are currently being abused! I know you were abused and I admire you for going through that and not taking your life. Now you can instead help them who need help now! Join an organization that can connect you with these people. Once again live life with utmost fulfillment. Think like this ""If i never had the problems i have now, what would I imagine myself like""! I know you can do it.\n\n\n(Apologizes for being disorganized in my answer)\n', '8': ""This may sound weird, but I really enjoyed your post. I know you are down but I think there is a lot of good in your life. For some people that is inspirational as it is a reminder that depression and mental disorders can affect anyone at any time. \n\n\nNot being bipolar myself, I am sure there is pain attached that I don't see. That said, I think your long term struggles may really be a strength in some ways. Many people fall into depression when they hit a wall after a long term manic episode. Not so say we are all bipolar, but everyone had ups and downs. Hopefully, and I assume owning a successful  buisness and finding love are indicators, you have the ability to detect you mood and energy. Many people fall far deeper into depression simply because they dont recognize the rut. We all can forget from time to time, that these are just low points and there will be a more elevated mood coming soon. So try not to forget that yourself. The pain you are feeling will pass. Things get better.\n\nOn the note of feeling suicidal. It sounds to me like you feel trapped. You have a successful buisness that you think you are better staying in but you are tired of maybe the consistant work load. Your husband is a wonderful guy, but some of the spark and energy is gone. So you are in duality of constantly thinking: should I stay or should I go. Thinking on this constantly can be so exhausting that it seems like the easiest choice is to end your pain. But that is not rational anymore. Obviously everyone around you will be worse off with you dead than if you chose to separate from one or both.\n\nI have two recommendations to help.\n\nFirst, if you are not seeing a therapist or counselor, I would suggest discussing your issues with one. Hopefully they can help you root out your desires and choose a path forward.\n\nSecond, I would try journaling your feelings. Personally, I think a pro and con list could be damaging, so I would just focus on what your mind is thinking, and write that down. Instead of keeping your thoughts in your head it helps you to get out ideas without judgement or anguish. Write in your phone or a computer if you dont like the idea of pen to paper. \n\nI hope this helps. \n\nAs a personal afternote, I am a 29M and married. A few months ago I had some personal drama going on and found telling my wife I loved her as I walked out the door and feeling like I was lying. I felt aweful and guilty and confused. Much like you, my partner loves me and wants a future and honestly there are few things I could find to be negative about with her. \n\nFeeling disconnected from her, I started considering all the things I disliked of her. I found basically 5 things in my life that I was not happy about. Some were directly related to her, others where just in my head. This lead to talking. Me discussing with her and admitting I was in a negative place. I never told her that I didnt think I loved her, but communicated all the other issues and a feeling of disconnect. Relationships require communicating our feelings with our partners. \n\nWe worked on some things, but ultimately i have discovered that my appriciation with her is much more about me than her or anyone else. When we like ourselves and our life and accept ourselves, we like those in our lives an appriciate them more. I won't say i am not occasionally still disconnected from her, but we have had a great couple of days lately, and she is at work now while I am at home. I can say I miss her and love her and it is an honest change from just a few months ago.\n\nFor me at least, life is fucking weird and sometimes you have to roll through the bad to get back to the good. It's like following a GPS down a shitty road. The GPS may have you on it for miles but once you realize you dont like the road and you want off, it may require a detour and some driving down the same road, but the sooner you realize, the sooner you can find an improvement. Killing yourself would just be a crash on a shitty road. That is no way to end this trip.\n\nGood luck and I hope this helps. Sorry for such a long post. \n"", '9': ""Wow, I actually feel a lot like i'm trekking down this road.  I felt like I had a career, and got a new /better paying job in the industry.  They rave about me, they say it to my face.  It pains me to wake up early every morning and put on dress clothes and sit in traffic for half an hour.  I am losing interest in most things I cared about.  I'm trying to push my friends away, including my best friend who is like nah i'm here no matter what.  Good friend, obviously, but I really want her to just get tired and fuck off.  I still have my SO though, who is supportive and caring and I hope I'm not pushing him away too.  But Even with this perfect person, I still feel so lost.  It's not the answer to anyone's problems, maybe a temporary solution at best.\n\nI'm sorry that you're going through this, and I've never seen a therapist so i'm trying that as soon as and hopefully when I get a return call to the voicemail i left the closest psychiatrist in my network?  But you're definitely not alone.  And if you've had any sort of good moments in your life, or things that you've enjoyed at some point, I think you need to fight to get that back.  That's what i'm trying to do, at least, and I don't think anyone can do that for me except myself, but i'm hopeful that someone will be able to assist me professionally and sort of guide the way?  I don't fucking know, really.   But i'll try to fight and I hope you will too.  Anyway, I was definitely listening, thank you for sharing."", '10': ""i've been diagnosed with depression since i was 5, but had total handle on it for the most part from let's say 6-17. 18-20 were bad. 21 now and lately i've been feeling really good. have had some bad days here and there but mainly due to a lot of different external and internal factors things are going great. the difference is mainly, you feel lighter in a way. not sure exactly how to describe it but in a sense, it's the difference between a malfunctioning car that keeps stopping or being really rocky and you have to strain yourself to press hard on the gas, and a car running smoothly that you don't have to put much thought into. i want to be social and it's easy to talk and have fun with people. it's much easier to meet new people. i actually am able to work really, really hard on my goals as opposed to knowing what they are but being lazy about them and seeing my life going nowhere. i feel like life is moving forward and i'm having fun along the way instead of being stuck in this slow-motion jelly format where i'm straining to get through total monotony and boredom. for me personally, one of my main symptoms is having a severe fear of death that interferes with me being able to live normally, and wanting it all to end because i feel like i'm in a pointless game that will mean nothing one day. i know everyone at some point has that feeling at one time or another, but for me when it's bad, that feeling overpowers every second of my life, and i'm extremely scared and devastated every second, to the point where my mind literally cannot think of anything else. it's terrifying. when i'm doing well those thoughts go into total hibernation and i can just enjoy being in the moment. life is actually fun and i feel like i'm worth something, and i see myself achieving what i want."", '11': 'That sounds like me, pretty close. I\'ve been diagnosed with depression and struggling with it for decades. So you could have depression, with those symptoms. Others here at r/depression have commented about having or reaching a level of depression that\'s below sad, where a person stops feeling much. It\'s more likely a person has depression if a person also has other symptoms of depression too, such as loss of interests and disrupted sleep patterns.\n\nSo I\'m reading your comment again, because I can\'t say for sure. Point by point, where are we similar or different?\n\nApologizing for posting or commenting, sometimes before getting to the point? Similar.\n\nClaiming to feel okay in general? Similar. If I think about how my body feels, it\'s usually okay, and that doesn\'t seem to have anything to do with emotions, it seems about my state of health and whether I\'m physically tired. It\'s a low chance at any minute that I\'m in the middle of feeling sad, which I would notice because I would be crying or feeling the symptoms of crying such as sore eyes or a lump in the throat. I might be in that state 0 minutes a day in some weeks, and averaging 30 minutes a day in other weeks when I\'m thinking about past problems in my life more. It\'s a lower chance I\'d be smiling or laughing in any minute. I usually wouldn\'t say that I ""feel happy"" as a way of describing it, if am in the middle of smiling or laughing that I may get for a few seconds in a day.\n\nThinking one has problems feeling anything or problems feeling anything strongly? Similar. I didn\'t realize this was a problem, because I just didn\'t know what other people meant by ""feeling."" I thought that my thoughts about situations and how those thoughts seemed to me, such as what tone of voice I would imagine expressing them in, was my emotions, and I thought everyone else was like that. Since I found out it\'s so different for other people, two months ago, I\'ve been trying to figure out what the difference is or what\'s going on with me. I think maybe the feelings that I would feel somewhere in my body, somehow, if I were more normal, are subliminal to me, so that I just know in my mind what my emotional reaction is to a thought in the minute or my mood is over an hour, but I don\'t literally ""feel"" it, unless there\'s a strong reaction such as crying. A reaction could be an expression of anger where if it\'s strong I\'ll get some tension in my gut and warmth in my face. Warmth in my face could be from embarrassment, or just anything. So I don\'t use the literal feeling as a way to tell what my emotion is. It wouldn\'t make sense that way. That would be totally unreliable. The literal feelings are just sensations of expressing something, which tells me that the emotion I already knew I was having in my mind is a strong emotion. Anger that\'s literally felt that much, that I\'m sure about, is maybe once a month.\n\nCrying about things read or seen? Not so similar. I\'ll cry if I think about how something I think or read or see relates to what\'s wrong in my life, or the life of someone I know. I\'d think it would be weird to cry about something in news or entertainment, without a personal connection or a personal thought about it. For instance, when I saw Titanic in a theater, I cried when all the people were falling off the ship into the water, because I thought life is like that: things are going along, then people die. When the movie tries to get people to cry with the little story about a romantic fling and which of those two characters dies or survives, that didn\'t matter as much to me.\n\nNot much behind crying or laughing? Similar for laughing, not similar for crying. When I\'m laughing, what\'s behind it is I noticed something funny, and that\'s unimportant. When I\'m crying, there are thoughts that are really important to me involved, that I can be concerned about as problems even if not crying.\n\nAfter laughing feeling the same as before? Similar, but what else would you expect? Seriously, is there supposed to be some effect? Is there supposed to be an effect on literal feelings, from laughing?\n\nCan stop crying at any moment? A little similar, but sometimes it\'s worse so it would take a minute to completely stop the expression of crying.\n\nNever getting angry or disappointed when something bad happens? Halfway similar. I\'ve noticed when I get angry is when there\'s something I\'m trying to do something very important and I have to deal with a computerized phone system that keeps making mistakes because it wants me to say something by voice, and I have to yell at it to be clear, and it still gets it wrong again and again, instead of just letting me press buttons. It\'s like they make those phone systems for important services with the intention of torturing people emotionally and messing with their lives. I never get angry that much at people in person. Disappointment is real, but it\'s in my mind. If you meant an emotion, I don\'t know, maybe if it leads to crying more because life is so awful.\n\nNot being able to care about people? No, I care enough to worry, and give people things when they need something. I cry about memories after someone I knew dies.\n\nNot feeling bad about never getting something wanted? Similar, halfway. Since wanting something is just a thought, and there are so many different things that a person could get or do in life, there\'s usually not any bad feeling about it, and I think that\'s the way it\'s supposed to be. However, if I think about how I\'ve missed out on doing certain things that other people almost all do, over so many years, and there seems to be something unfair about it, or some thought that it might never happen for me, then I may cry about it.\n\nNot knowing if one really enjoys activities or not? Similar.\n\nNot getting a ""good job"" feeling from one\'s brain? Similar. What does that even mean though? Do people get feelings from things they do, other than from the results? For instance, if a person cooks something, there can be a feeling from the result: tasting it and it tastes good. There\'s your feeling. Making music, you hear the music and it sounds like music. There\'s your feeling. Drawing, you finish a picture, and it looks like an interesting picture. There\'s your feeling. Why would you even expect anything else?\n\nNot knowing if all this is normal or wrong? Similar.\n\nI\'m sorry about how long this response is. It\'s like usual for me, what else am I going to do? I\'m not sure what I want. This subject of emotions seems important to me, so I write things that long for myself. Why not share it? It seems fair since you posted at a place that takes comments, so maybe you want a comment.', '12': 'First off, even ugly, quiet and boring people can get someone to love them. I have seen many men/women who are considered ""ugly"" walking around with handsome men/women. Sure, they might be the minority, but there\'s still the chance.\n\nThat said, I want to share something that is a bit similar. I have always been a quiet boy and always had only 1 true friend. Around 5 years ago (when I was like 20years old) when I went to a new school, there was a girl who shared similar interests/hobbies like me and after a few months we started talking and walking together to the bus station every day. It had been quite an enjoyable experience for me, having been kinda lonely lots of times and never really had a female friend. Well, after some time (around the time school was finished) she asked me out to some event with her friends and I accepted but when day of the event came, my social anxiety kicked in and I found some random excuses to stay at home. While we still could be considered friends after that I never got the courage to go past just ""talking and walking together"", always scared that I am not worthy/good enough for her. After school finished I pretty much lost contact with her since we never got past ""school friends"". Now I am 25 years old and still have a lonely life and every day I regret being scared and not having the courage to be more than ""school friends"". If you have depression, having regrets makes it way worse.\n\nSo, my advice to you is, while easier said than done, is to make the right choice so that in the future, you won\'t have any regrets.\n\nApart from that, I can\'t really give any better advice since I am not really better than you in this case. The only thing I can think of is that you should ask him why he chose you and if it\'s really fine to go with him to the prom. Basically, try to know more of his thoughts.', '13': 'I understand that therapy may not have been helpful where you went or your therapist wasn\'t a good fit. This has happened to me before. Take a break now if thats what you see fit for yourself but I would encourage you to do some research into different therapists in your area to possibly see if one stands out to you. Ask around too. Each therapist is different and has a different approach, is important to find one thats a good fit for you. Especially if you are/are not religious. Its important to find something that fits you. Alas, therapy may not be for you. Try journalling, self tracking, self help, coping skills, etc. \n\nAs far ad your medications. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE go off of them slowly. Even better, refer to your doctor when going off of them. I had a ""fuck the system"" mentality and dropped off my Lexapro 20mg basically cold turkey. Sent me into one GNARLY manic break. Ended a nearly 2 year relationship, convinced my university I was healed and to be let back in despite academic standing, never needed to sleep, rang up some pretty credit card debt, etc. Its not an experience I would recommend. So cut them in half or something I guess. But you should really refer to your doctor when going off of any meds. \n\nWhen I went on my Wellbutrin 75mg I was not happy about it. I really didnt want to. But I had a great psych that put me on a med thats a better fit than I had before. Ive chosen to stay on it until I\'m through IOP and DBT therapy and feel I am at a stable point in my life to learn to navigate life off of the meds. For now I view it a little bit more as a stabilizer while we are still trying to get everything sorted out. \n\nLook into support groups, they are often less expensive and more open than therapy is. Just a suggestion. \n\n', '14': 'Glad I could help!\n\nNo, I know. That\'s why when I hear of any reunions (whether it\'s someone else\'s making me think of my own coming up one day) I get really anxious because I think about going back to that. And, in a way, for me it\'s also because I feel like I\'m not done becoming who I really want to be and am proud of showing off yet? And, maybe that\'s a little shallow, but it\'s like I\'m not on social media really or it\'s really hidden to where people can\'t track it back to me, and when I went off to college I basically have been on radio silence. When I make myself more ""public"" all around to people (including those from my past maybe) I want to be...""finished""?\n\nAnd I know that\'s a weird, personal hang up and that no one\'s ever really done ""growing"" but I feel so malleable still in every aspect of my life.\n\nThat\'s great to hear! Baby steps, and hey, you had a conversation with someone, that\'s new and you did it! Roots take time to grow, but you\'ll get there.\n\nHaha yeah, we were all absolutely MISERABLE at the time, but looking back, it\'s an amusing story to tell for me now. I think another thing about college, and life in general that I had forgotten until I was typing up that last sentence is that, it\'s partly having that different community to do your growing (less than a year, a year, 2 years, 4 years, etc.), making connections with people for when you get out, and just....having those experiences and stories to look back on in life.\n\nI didn\'t really do a whole lot with my years mainly because I had it hammered home that I needed to just focus on my studies and get out and get a job immediately (VEEEEEEERY unrealistic in many cases) and I was depressed. I\'m glad for the moments I did have and I look back on that with the most fondness. I could\'ve done more, yes, but I try not to ""regret"" my path and I did what I could with getting my depression actually figured out for the first time.\n\nI\'m kind of doing that now in my life. Trying things out and actively looking into what the city has to offer in terms of events/etc. and just trying things. Even if it has to be by myself, I have to be okay with that too. It\'s kind of empowering almost being okay by yourself if it comes to that. Just, also, be safe about it.\n\nTry out some clubs! I never did but for my sister and brother (currently in college) and it seems to be working for them. My brother also is on the autistism spectrum and has severe OCD so his social cues aren\'t the best, but apparently he\'ll just start chatting with people in the public commons area and people seem to react well to that. Which is a relief to me because he was very much bullied up until high school.\n\nAgain, you\'re doing what you can, something will come of it. :)', '15': 'Hey.\n\n\nI am in a rough patch right now, and I want to give you some advice. It\'s better to work on what you can change so you have one less worry of. Alright? For example, I\'m working a 9-to-5 job doing some work that I find utterly meaningless, but what is the alternative? Having no structure in my life, being broke, etc. I\'d rather be depressed over one less thing (money, too much time left to my chaotic thoughts), than over many problems I perceive in my life.\n\n\n""all my passion for instruments and music thrown away"" you are so lucky to be good at music (i\'m sure you are). As much as I have tried, i suck at the piano and am tone deaf. Please work on your music and practice constantly. Structure your daily routine and stick to it, and you will feel better.\n\n\n""im so fat and ugly"" why do you say that? are you really ""fat"" like your BMI is too high, or are you projecting your thoughts like that? some small ways to help yourself is to get into a routine of cooking, reject larger meal portions, eat healthily (if you cook it\'s cheaper). I\'m assuming that since you\'re 15 you have plenty of free time to explore some new hobbies.\n\n\nCollege might be worthless to you right now, but it\'s meaningful for me and a lot of other people. Im not from the US so my college fees aren\'t outrageously expensive, but it\'s a massive privilege to talk to extremely intellectual professors and bounce ideas off each other. It\'s a good time to figure out what you want in life and learn useful skill sets, if you structure your life enough to give you the time to do something meaningful. Otherwise you will fritter your life away.\n\n\nI am aware the tough love and advice approach might not be what you want to hear, you can always rant on Reddit. But you\'re just 15, and I wish I could be 15 again and pick up everything and every skill that I didn\'t take seriously at that point. Watch some of Dr Jordan B Peterson\'s videos on YouTube about depression. They will help you. All the best.', '16': 'So, I have a lot of experience with inpatient. I\'ll write my rather long story below, but keep the helpful stuff up here in case you don\'t want to read it. In short, I will not go back to inpatient due to many issues I had while hospitalized. The mental healthcare in my area is severely lacking, and felt like something out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest. However, you live in a metropolitan area, so I have no doubt your experience will be much better than mine, so **please don\'t let my story prevent you from getting help**. If you feel you are in danger, please go to the best hospital you can afford, go to the ER, and they will handle it from there. It sounds like you could really benefit from being inpatient.\n\n\n\nAnyway, here are my experiences...\n\nI live in NY and have been in three different inpatient facilities. One was an independent center, and the other two were psychiatric wings in hospitals. \n\nI\'ll be completely honest with you, every single time I\'ve been, I beg the doctors to let me out. I thought going would help me, but when I am there it feels like I\'m trapped. I do not feel the facilities I went to helped me in any way, BUT they did keep me alive. \n\n\nHere\'s what you can probably expect if you decide to check yourself in: You will not have control of your day. You will be told when to wake up, when to eat, and when you have to go to ""groups"" (more on those later). You will have some leisure time, but don\'t expect to be able to whip out a book and read whenever you want to. \n\n\nAt the independent center the care was so bad, it was just unreal. I would be given sleep inducing drugs, then get in trouble when I would skip groups to sleep. Which is crazy, considering I was being given benadryl and other things that are known to knock people out. They had a very strict attendance policy for the group sessions, which honestly weren\'t even that helpful since you would go to the same one once a week. It felt like I had no control over my life, not even my own body, since by the time I left I had 10 drugs prescribed to me. By the time I left they had banned me from ever returning. No joke. I was very vocal about my issues, and I guess that was enough to not allow me back. I have tried to check myself in again but every time they say I am not allowed. I ask why, and they say it\'s because I skipped group...for sleeping, when they gave me sleep inducing meds. It makes me angry to think about. When I spoke to a nurse on the phone to figure out why I was banned, she said, ""We didn\'t seem to help you much the last time, so what would be different this time?"" \n\n\nThe hospitals are a much safer bet. If you have dietary issues, make sure you are upfront about it. I was basically given nothing to eat since I was vegetarian and have milk and corn allergies. One of the hospitals didn\'t give me my daily allergy medications because some lazy fuck decided not to write them down, so I had to *actually break down in tears* to get the staff to call a doctor from the ER so I could get my prescriptions. Which I genuinely need since I am allergic to just about everything. If I ever need to go back I know which hospital I will be going to, and it\'s not the one where the orderlies laughed in my face when I was crying and begging for my medicine, which I need to breathe properly.\n\n\nSo, would I recommend it? Yes. Despite everything that has happened to me during inpatient, it will prevent you from killing or harming yourself, which is all that really matters. In my opinion it is basically a step above prison, but I still recommend it if you think you need it. Just don\'t expect to be very comfortable while you\'re there. \n\n\n\n\n', '17': 'Because I am just like you. My sense of training, motivation, and purpose is helping others. It gives me worth, and it helps me Believe that life is different than this feeling I have reinforcing how pointless it is. I find Myself constantly trying to replay banjo kazooie and hoping for the feeling of butterflies I use to get to return but it never does. So I realized I have to move on and find my own butterflies again, and that’s when I realized that instead of looking back at all the good moments that gave me that feeling that every moment really is so special. That moment that your crying and your mom sat there with you til you felt better, how important that was to my development, that something mattered and somebody cared and somebody did something so selfless. That I could be that person to someone, or that there’s someone out there right now feeling exactly like I did but they don’t realize  that it is a pivotal moment because they have something inside them suppressing the idea. \n\nIn a way I think everyone on this thread is the same. We all looked up a way to discuss our inner loneliness without looking crazy to our peers because we intend to give them a sense that we are okay to not make things worse, it’s part of our subconscious crying out for help '}",<b> You may want to take a look at these highly rated comments: </b>,click event

Where are you in your life at the moment? In terms of age, job, financial position, weight? \n\nI\'m 28 and going through a major existential crises of complete confusion and despair. Most of my day is spent trying to bat of any feeling of deep insecurity. But strangely that has translated into only enjoying conversation with strangers. Although, they rarely happen as I developed anxiety. But when they do, I actually do enjoy them, after the initial feeling of ""fuck someone who is talking to me"". I don\'t have any friends, never been great at managing relationships anyway but over the last 2 years, I\'m just ashamed of who I am so it\'s much better to speak to strangers who don\'t know you, then those who have this image of who you used to be.  I used to love going out, meeting people being social. Now not so much. I find myself not amused by anything really. In the same way you do. For me it\'s again because I\'ve stacked up at 0 in my career, financially and in personal development. I\'m sure if those areas were recharged and replenished I would start enjoying life a bit more but at the moment it\'s all pretty much the same. Sub par mood, with continuous feelings of hate for who I\'ve become. Pretty awesome right. \n\nStupid question but how open are you creatively? Do you, maybe not now, but in the past, try new things? Whether it be hobbies or parts of life you never even thought about? I am super open and always have been. So for me, I\'ve tried this and unfortunately doesn\'t work consistently but I pick up a book or watch a doc or go to an exhibition about something I know nothing about. Like I said unfortunetly it hasn\'t worked for me in any sifnicant and meaningful way but sometimes I do get absorbed by a new topic area. I literally paid zero attention to politics and sociology, but recently find myself reading and watching a lot of content on things like ""left vs right"" or ""class structures"" or reasons for inequality. ', '1': ""I miswrote that on accident actually. For a couple weeks I've fixed in my mind to do it tomorrow on Sunday at a specific time, I don't know why I wrote tomorrow last night. \n\nDo I want to live? Yes. Define living though. In my opinion living is only really living if you have the color of emotions in your life which I lost many years ago. Something which is impossible to regain. Find a hobby and enjoy it? Sure, the second half of that is where the real trouble comes though. I can't physically enjoy it, regardless of how interesting or fun it seems like it should be to me. Take in nature? I do think nature is very beautiful. I can't physically enjoy being in it though.\n\nI'm not sure if you can comprehend this concept if you haven't lost your emotions. I took them for granted. There is actually emotion attached to everything, you always feel it wherever you are and I distinctly remember it even though I only remember feeling it in elementary school. It really colors your life. But now that I've lost the ability to feel emotion? I can't feel a damn thing. Take for instance a couple weeks ago. Went on a date with this beautiful girl and we held hands and danced. But I felt nothing. And I remember what love felt like, it was extremely powerful. I felt like I should love this girl for a multitude of reasons but I just didn't *feel* it. Dancing with her should've been special, but emotionally it felt the same as doing any other mundane thing in life like taking out the trash or working. I'm so numb nothing feels different. For this reason I can't enjoy anything I used to, not hobbies, not being with friends, not anything at all. I felt more joy years ago when my life was shit than I do now. \n\nAgain I'm not sure you or anyone else can comprehend this without feeling it for yourself. Take it from me though, life is colorless without emotion and everything is the same dull grey regardless of what it is. I cannot physically enjoy anything. There is no joy to be had. Life pales in comparison to what it used to be, and guess what? It used to be a lot shittier just a few years ago, but at least I had emotions.  At least I could have fun doing things. What used to interest me like videogames or drawing which I could do for hours on end, now I can only do for ten minutes max and it's fucking hard to get myself to do it, as if it's some sort of chore. "", '2': 'I tried to analyze your text, and commenting on some things. Check it out if you want \\^\\^\n\nIf we would sum the text up, you could say that the deciding factors which kept you in this pessimistic and downleading spiral, were:\n\n1. Fighting the depression *alone.*\n\nThis is something that I have reflected upon as well. Having this burden of feeling of not being enough to anyone, or that you do not get any acknowledgement, is just horrible. It is downright depressing being the guy that compares his life with others. Because, no matter how you compare yourself with anyone else, I have learned that you ALWAYS LOSE. For me at least, because I compare my bad sides with everyone elses\' good. \n\n2. There was a lack of hobbies / interests\n\nNow, this for me is a difficult question because I am having a hard time finding things that amuse me. Note that I am not depressed, but I have very few real interests that lets my passion burn for what it is. And, honestly I do not know how to deal with this. It\'s just hard. Really, but as long as we strive for something better, I can just hope that we find something that fulfills us one day.\n\n3. Lack of purpose\n\nI think the crucial factor here to why we lack purpose, is that our society is built upon materialistic needs. We work, to buy. To consume, and to sleep. We lack the culture of Eastern civilization, aka, spirituality. Now, if you are an athiest, then you can take this with a grain of salt since depression does not work well with religion. Been there, done that, after all. But I believe finding meaning from within you, like trying to find hobbies and people to share your life with, is what will give you purpose. Maybe not directly, but with time, it could turn out to become a ""fake it till you make it"" solution. It is the root of depression that we want to get rid of right, and you obviously already have started to work with yourself. Yet, **and you should remember this:** you might have self reflected your whole life, but if you only Q and A yourself, then a lot of good theorizing might become lost. \n\nAlso even if you are in the darkest depths of hell where darkness suffocates you, there is a small light and the light can only be found in two things: You. *Or,* someone else. Peace and love. Jaaam', '3': 'I have the same situation and every day I think what can I do to improve it.\n\nI think the biggest reason for being ""boring"" is lack of confidence and lack of communication skills.\n\nI didn\'t do it yet but I\'m planning on taking a communication course to improve my overall skills because I was always somewhat shy and basically not a very talkative person.\n\nI think that will automatically improve my confidence but I\'ll try working on it even more with other things, like working out, going out more, try and get into ""awkward"" conversations and try to just deal with it instead of ""running away"". Like everything else, I should get better at it with time.\n\nAnother thing that I think is a reason for being boring is that we don\'t have a lot of interest for anything so we don\'t really have much to talk about. Find something that actually interests you and just read more about it, find people with the same interests and share opinions, although I still think the main two reasons are confidence and communication skills because I for example am a big fan of sport, but even when I talk about sport with others, I have a feeling that the other person doesn\'t have a lot of interest in what I\'m saying. \n\nAppearance, how you deliver the message is most important, and we\'re maybe not good at it right now, but we can get good at it, we just need to want it :)', '4': 'It\'s ok bro, I did not start working until I was 21 in last November. I\'m about to turn 22 now. I am still working on my GED, almost done right now once I finish the geometry chapter. I feel you. 19 is nothing, 21 is though lol. I get what you mean by:\n\n&gt; but the adult world just seems so far fetched and advanced\n\nIt\'s not. Everyone is a bunch of big children trying to present an image of something higher. There is no higher. We are children inside forever. People don\'t give a fuck, we are all in this weird crazy game and confused. Things go smooth and natural because of that. Nothing to be scared of.\n\n&gt;I am having a problem with what kind of job I’d like to get\n\nStop thinking about it from this stressful perspective. To do that, get any job you can; apply for a supermarket or whatever. Basically any job will give you real world experience and a more complete understanding of life, and then you can think more realistically when you get a deeper understanding of the value of time etc.\n\n&gt;but at the same time you want to enjoy what you’re doing right?\n\nThis is an excuse. You should instead think like so: ""I will probably enjoy any job that comes to me."" -- I push supermarket carts for a living, it\'s bad for my back and the pay is shit of course, but it\'s a very enjoyable job for me. Everyone tells me they hate that or it sounds shit. People love to be haters, but being a hater is childish &amp; inferior to acceptance of what you have. And hey, I may not be known for superficial things like creating a fuckin\' movie and making $2 billion, but I\'m known for being a really great hearted kind cool person, what really matters.\n\nMy advice is stop giving so much of a shit. That\'s good that you want to get a job that serves importance to the world -- but so what? The vast majority of people, intelligent or not, are forced to work shitty jobs before they can do what they want to do. I think if you just get a shitty job and start small from there, your mind will be clearer.', '5': 'I am actually glad that you posted this, because I feel the same way and I have never been able to express this to anyone or make anyone understand. When my depression got to it\'s worst point, this was what I thought about constantly- I couldn\'t be without something to occupy my mind because this is where my thoughts would drift and I would get terrified and feel like my head was spinning and feel nauseous. There were a million other problems I had/have due to my depression but this is probably the worst. It made it harder that everyone I have met, or communicated with who has depression doesn\'t fear death and doesn\'t obsess over the fear of death but rather wants to die/commit suicide etc. \nI will always say that I am a huge supporter of medication for depression for those who need it. It took me a couple of tries on meds, it\'s not the most fun process, but when I finally landed on the one that worked for me (wellbutrin), I noticed within weeks that the obsession over these thoughts diminished significantly. I was able to focus on my life because I wasn\'t constantly haunted with the thoughts. This was amazing to me because having the thoughts only contributes to the cycle of being depressed. \nI still have the moments, in the shower or laying in bed before falling asleep where I think about how everyone who is old always says ""life goes so fast,"" and it does go faster the more time goes on. I\'m terrified of aging because I know that it brings me closer to death. I dread the thought that one day I will be old and just awaiting my death, and I can\'t go back, can\'t change a thing, can\'t buy more time. \nPeople always say that you matter to others, and you\'ve made impacts in others lives, or that they needed you. That\'s true, and I am thankful that I have been there for those who needed me. It\'s hard to explain, but I still don\'t find that helpful at all because I think about how that only matters because we exist in the first place. If none of us existed it wouldn\'t matter at all. If those people hadn\'t been born it wouldn\'t matter at all. We exist solely to keep the race existing which feels meaningless to me. I often feel anger because we are living in a cruel world and I often resent the fact that I/humans were given a brain so capable of emotion, such deep thought, feeling so deeply, such a longing for meaning yet in the end we are never granted that (besides through religion, which doesn\'t work for me). \nThe thought of ceasing to exist in itself also terrifies me, the thought of not being, of not seeing what happens to the world, of simply turning to dust and hundreds of years later never being remembered. Even if souls remain and spirits exist, I fear watching years from a distance unable to speak with or touch my loved ones. Years and years in the future, the earth will be gone along with me and everything we ever did as humans here will no longer matter. \nI also wish many times that I was never born so I never had to feel these things. I refuse to have children for these reasons. I refuse to pass the depression and these feelings on to another human being, I wouldn\'t wish it upon anyone. That to me would be one of the most cruel things I could do. But I also refuse to have children because I feel that you spend your life getting attached to people who will eventually die. If nothing else takes you first, you have some good years. Then your grandparents or relatives die, your parents die, then your siblings may die before you. Whoever doesn\'t die before you is left with the sadness of losing you. So many people are obsessed with focusing their whole life on their career, years and years of education (Sometimes this makes people happy, education can make you happy, and that is awesome- I don\'t mean to put this down in all circumstances but many who go to college hate it- myself included). They waste their lives away, stressed out about work and money, only to make it to being old and now all your good years are gone. \nWhat I have gained that is positive from these thoughts is realizing that I should do what makes me happy because the time I have is short. When I am laying in my death bed I don\'t want to be thinking about what I should\'ve done, or shouldn\'t have, or how I should\'ve focused on the people I loved. Fuck what everyone else tells me I need to do to be happy- I don\'t need to have kids, I don\'t need to have a wildly successful career. If you\'re genuinely happy working at a grocery store and it pays your bills honestly who the fuck cares if everyone else is saying ""oh, that\'s not a career, that\'s not right, you should be somewhere else."" Never listen to anyone who says ""When I was your age I had x or y by now!"" It\'s a whole different playing field for this generation. I seek jobs and work that make me happy, or, at least, don\'t make me miserable. I refuse to stay in a job where I am miserable. I worked hard to get my credit to a good score so that I could take a vacation to Hawaii at 23 years old, and pay it off over a few months. Do whatever you can to do the things that make you happy while you are young. Traveling or whatever else makes you happy will be more difficult when you are old (When it\'s hard to walk, when you have tons of medications or who knows what else; a need for insulin, an oxygen tank). \nHopefully sharing how I feel didn\'t make you more depressed, I suppose the points I wanted to make are that there is no shame in medication or counseling. Don\'t let people who have never had depression try to tell you anything about it, how to fix it, or that it\'s invalid. Don\'t let them try and tell you things about medication, because at the end of the day, sure there are terrible problems with the pharmaceutical industry but antidepressants save lives in more ways than one. I highly recommend studying the psychology of depression/ how dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine etc. work. It helps you gain a great understanding that you are sick (just like someone with any other disease) and your brain doesn\'t work like other peoples instead of feeling ridiculous and invalid. And lastly, use every moment you have wisely, really do the things that make you happy. Don\'t let yourself be walked all over. Figure out how to realistically achieve your goals/happiness, because simply hearing ""life is great, you can do anything if you put your mind to it, this guy went from nothing to a millionaire so you can too!"" Doesn\'t help you feel motivated when you have depression at all. \nI wish you the best, you aren\'t alone!', '6': ""I'm going to repeat what other people have said and tell you that my relationship with my therapist is more important to me than the type. I've 'shopped around' for therapists before, because if I didn't feel a certain amount of security and trust, it just wasn't going to work. I usually give it around 3 meetings before I bail (if I feel like finding someone else), just in case one of us was having a bad day.\n\nI'm doing DBT right now, with isn't too different from CBT in a lot of ways. I'm supposed to practice different skills to help adjust my want of thinking. Making goal lists, finding ways to cope with emotional emergencies, tracking how often I feel like killing myself, that kind of thing. It's kind of tough but I actually found apps that help. The more personal stuff is kind of like pulling apart why I might feel a certain way so I can try to get past it. Even then, sometimes it ends up more important to find out what exactly I'm thinking or feeling than the older whys and stuff. I say 'I don't know' a lot, and I really like my therapist because she's okay with that answer and helps me pinpoint a more discerning reply. I find it insightful and helpful.\n\nI'd say most of the different therapies and therapists I've tried generally start out with almost an interview process, where you try to figure out if everything is a good fit. Like, if your wants and needs and goals line up with what that person offers. I've flat out left and never gone back when one therapist tried to tell me that I didn't want to get better hard enough. That was a bunch of shit and I never looked back. We obviously had different approaches. Lots of therapists will also try to get an assessment of how you feel and certain behavioral patterns because they'll want a formal evaluation. It's not unusual, although some of the questions might be interpreted as personal? Like if you take drugs, or how much you smoke or drink, have you ever been sexually assaulted, etc. But other stuff like how often you sleep or eat, if you've lost or gained weight, how you feel about crowds. Being honest about it all is important, since that's how they'll both diagnose and start tailoring treatment for you.\n\nCBT and DBT might be up your alley. I like things a little more personal and DBT doesn't give me too much of that, but my therapist as an individual does so it works out. Again, compatibility."", '7': 'Hi there. First of all I am sorry to hear that you\'re going through a depression and taking medication. While I have experienced depression, I\'m happy to finally be able to get through it in the end. Here are some observations I found about myself during that time:\n\n1. The reason for my depression is because I feel victimized: At the time I suddenly felt my parents were not people I actually respected. My long lost love ended up with another guy while I was still dreaming of her every night, so what\'s the use of all the connections we once had? Well I realized this was the problem. First of all whatever happened in the past doesn\'t really matter. My expectations that I put on some other person should\'t make me entitled to be victimized. After all, these are just other human beings who do what makes them happy. If someone left you and did not come back its because you couldn\'t make them happy. Now the option is learn from it and change (you could still be together in the future) or feel victimized. \n2. The reason for my depression is I don\'t have friends that I can stick with: During this time I was in college and most of my high school friends were somewhere else. I tried to tell them about my depression and they could\'t really say anything to help. First of all if they are far away you can\'t always count on them. Don\'t expect them to. It doesn\'t mean they are not nice some are just not that interested in those things. That\'s what I learned. Moreover, it was also because I was scared to open up to anyone. So where can you find people who can start being friends with? best places would be either joining a volunteer organization, join a church group, or find any self-enriching clubs around you, You are bound to find new friends there. But that\'s not enough. You need to start thinking this way ""I am young and have so many years in front of me. I am not have 23 years of my life back but I want to live the next years from now on with happiness and fulfillment"" So you take that leap. Away from your past and let the experiences in the next years define you. Be friends. Experience nature. Experience love once more. Find a career that makes you fulfilled. Don\'t settle for depression.\n\n3. The reason for my depression is because of I am thinking about myself: At the end of the day you realize you are breathing, you can still eat, you can still walk and you can still drink alcohol without any consequences to your body. You have access to internet! You have access to people. You still have the ability to move town (Well if you\'re strapped for cash I guess begin by saving up first then go). The possibilities for you is close to endless. But remember there are those who can\'t even do that. There are people who are suffering worst than you and they need physical help. They need you start thinking of solutions for them. There are people who are currently being abused! I know you were abused and I admire you for going through that and not taking your life. Now you can instead help them who need help now! Join an organization that can connect you with these people. Once again live life with utmost fulfillment. Think like this ""If i never had the problems i have now, what would I imagine myself like""! I know you can do it.\n\n\n(Apologizes for being disorganized in my answer)\n', '8': ""This may sound weird, but I really enjoyed your post. I know you are down but I think there is a lot of good in your life. For some people that is inspirational as it is a reminder that depression and mental disorders can affect anyone at any time. \n\n\nNot being bipolar myself, I am sure there is pain attached that I don't see. That said, I think your long term struggles may really be a strength in some ways. Many people fall into depression when they hit a wall after a long term manic episode. Not so say we are all bipolar, but everyone had ups and downs. Hopefully, and I assume owning a successful  buisness and finding love are indicators, you have the ability to detect you mood and energy. Many people fall far deeper into depression simply because they dont recognize the rut. We all can forget from time to time, that these are just low points and there will be a more elevated mood coming soon. So try not to forget that yourself. The pain you are feeling will pass. Things get better.\n\nOn the note of feeling suicidal. It sounds to me like you feel trapped. You have a successful buisness that you think you are better staying in but you are tired of maybe the consistant work load. Your husband is a wonderful guy, but some of the spark and energy is gone. So you are in duality of constantly thinking: should I stay or should I go. Thinking on this constantly can be so exhausting that it seems like the easiest choice is to end your pain. But that is not rational anymore. Obviously everyone around you will be worse off with you dead than if you chose to separate from one or both.\n\nI have two recommendations to help.\n\nFirst, if you are not seeing a therapist or counselor, I would suggest discussing your issues with one. Hopefully they can help you root out your desires and choose a path forward.\n\nSecond, I would try journaling your feelings. Personally, I think a pro and con list could be damaging, so I would just focus on what your mind is thinking, and write that down. Instead of keeping your thoughts in your head it helps you to get out ideas without judgement or anguish. Write in your phone or a computer if you dont like the idea of pen to paper. \n\nI hope this helps. \n\nAs a personal afternote, I am a 29M and married. A few months ago I had some personal drama going on and found telling my wife I loved her as I walked out the door and feeling like I was lying. I felt aweful and guilty and confused. Much like you, my partner loves me and wants a future and honestly there are few things I could find to be negative about with her. \n\nFeeling disconnected from her, I started considering all the things I disliked of her. I found basically 5 things in my life that I was not happy about. Some were directly related to her, others where just in my head. This lead to talking. Me discussing with her and admitting I was in a negative place. I never told her that I didnt think I loved her, but communicated all the other issues and a feeling of disconnect. Relationships require communicating our feelings with our partners. \n\nWe worked on some things, but ultimately i have discovered that my appriciation with her is much more about me than her or anyone else. When we like ourselves and our life and accept ourselves, we like those in our lives an appriciate them more. I won't say i am not occasionally still disconnected from her, but we have had a great couple of days lately, and she is at work now while I am at home. I can say I miss her and love her and it is an honest change from just a few months ago.\n\nFor me at least, life is fucking weird and sometimes you have to roll through the bad to get back to the good. It's like following a GPS down a shitty road. The GPS may have you on it for miles but once you realize you dont like the road and you want off, it may require a detour and some driving down the same road, but the sooner you realize, the sooner you can find an improvement. Killing yourself would just be a crash on a shitty road. That is no way to end this trip.\n\nGood luck and I hope this helps. Sorry for such a long post. \n"", '9': ""Wow, I actually feel a lot like i'm trekking down this road.  I felt like I had a career, and got a new /better paying job in the industry.  They rave about me, they say it to my face.  It pains me to wake up early every morning and put on dress clothes and sit in traffic for half an hour.  I am losing interest in most things I cared about.  I'm trying to push my friends away, including my best friend who is like nah i'm here no matter what.  Good friend, obviously, but I really want her to just get tired and fuck off.  I still have my SO though, who is supportive and caring and I hope I'm not pushing him away too.  But Even with this perfect person, I still feel so lost.  It's not the answer to anyone's problems, maybe a temporary solution at best.\n\nI'm sorry that you're going through this, and I've never seen a therapist so i'm trying that as soon as and hopefully when I get a return call to the voicemail i left the closest psychiatrist in my network?  But you're definitely not alone.  And if you've had any sort of good moments in your life, or things that you've enjoyed at some point, I think you need to fight to get that back.  That's what i'm trying to do, at least, and I don't think anyone can do that for me except myself, but i'm hopeful that someone will be able to assist me professionally and sort of guide the way?  I don't fucking know, really.   But i'll try to fight and I hope you will too.  Anyway, I was definitely listening, thank you for sharing."", '10': ""i've been diagnosed with depression since i was 5, but had total handle on it for the most part from let's say 6-17. 18-20 were bad. 21 now and lately i've been feeling really good. have had some bad days here and there but mainly due to a lot of different external and internal factors things are going great. the difference is mainly, you feel lighter in a way. not sure exactly how to describe it but in a sense, it's the difference between a malfunctioning car that keeps stopping or being really rocky and you have to strain yourself to press hard on the gas, and a car running smoothly that you don't have to put much thought into. i want to be social and it's easy to talk and have fun with people. it's much easier to meet new people. i actually am able to work really, really hard on my goals as opposed to knowing what they are but being lazy about them and seeing my life going nowhere. i feel like life is moving forward and i'm having fun along the way instead of being stuck in this slow-motion jelly format where i'm straining to get through total monotony and boredom. for me personally, one of my main symptoms is having a severe fear of death that interferes with me being able to live normally, and wanting it all to end because i feel like i'm in a pointless game that will mean nothing one day. i know everyone at some point has that feeling at one time or another, but for me when it's bad, that feeling overpowers every second of my life, and i'm extremely scared and devastated every second, to the point where my mind literally cannot think of anything else. it's terrifying. when i'm doing well those thoughts go into total hibernation and i can just enjoy being in the moment. life is actually fun and i feel like i'm worth something, and i see myself achieving what i want."", '11': 'That sounds like me, pretty close. I\'ve been diagnosed with depression and struggling with it for decades. So you could have depression, with those symptoms. Others here at r/depression have commented about having or reaching a level of depression that\'s below sad, where a person stops feeling much. It\'s more likely a person has depression if a person also has other symptoms of depression too, such as loss of interests and disrupted sleep patterns.\n\nSo I\'m reading your comment again, because I can\'t say for sure. Point by point, where are we similar or different?\n\nApologizing for posting or commenting, sometimes before getting to the point? Similar.\n\nClaiming to feel okay in general? Similar. If I think about how my body feels, it\'s usually okay, and that doesn\'t seem to have anything to do with emotions, it seems about my state of health and whether I\'m physically tired. It\'s a low chance at any minute that I\'m in the middle of feeling sad, which I would notice because I would be crying or feeling the symptoms of crying such as sore eyes or a lump in the throat. I might be in that state 0 minutes a day in some weeks, and averaging 30 minutes a day in other weeks when I\'m thinking about past problems in my life more. It\'s a lower chance I\'d be smiling or laughing in any minute. I usually wouldn\'t say that I ""feel happy"" as a way of describing it, if am in the middle of smiling or laughing that I may get for a few seconds in a day.\n\nThinking one has problems feeling anything or problems feeling anything strongly? Similar. I didn\'t realize this was a problem, because I just didn\'t know what other people meant by ""feeling."" I thought that my thoughts about situations and how those thoughts seemed to me, such as what tone of voice I would imagine expressing them in, was my emotions, and I thought everyone else was like that. Since I found out it\'s so different for other people, two months ago, I\'ve been trying to figure out what the difference is or what\'s going on with me. I think maybe the feelings that I would feel somewhere in my body, somehow, if I were more normal, are subliminal to me, so that I just know in my mind what my emotional reaction is to a thought in the minute or my mood is over an hour, but I don\'t literally ""feel"" it, unless there\'s a strong reaction such as crying. A reaction could be an expression of anger where if it\'s strong I\'ll get some tension in my gut and warmth in my face. Warmth in my face could be from embarrassment, or just anything. So I don\'t use the literal feeling as a way to tell what my emotion is. It wouldn\'t make sense that way. That would be totally unreliable. The literal feelings are just sensations of expressing something, which tells me that the emotion I already knew I was having in my mind is a strong emotion. Anger that\'s literally felt that much, that I\'m sure about, is maybe once a month.\n\nCrying about things read or seen? Not so similar. I\'ll cry if I think about how something I think or read or see relates to what\'s wrong in my life, or the life of someone I know. I\'d think it would be weird to cry about something in news or entertainment, without a personal connection or a personal thought about it. For instance, when I saw Titanic in a theater, I cried when all the people were falling off the ship into the water, because I thought life is like that: things are going along, then people die. When the movie tries to get people to cry with the little story about a romantic fling and which of those two characters dies or survives, that didn\'t matter as much to me.\n\nNot much behind crying or laughing? Similar for laughing, not similar for crying. When I\'m laughing, what\'s behind it is I noticed something funny, and that\'s unimportant. When I\'m crying, there are thoughts that are really important to me involved, that I can be concerned about as problems even if not crying.\n\nAfter laughing feeling the same as before? Similar, but what else would you expect? Seriously, is there supposed to be some effect? Is there supposed to be an effect on literal feelings, from laughing?\n\nCan stop crying at any moment? A little similar, but sometimes it\'s worse so it would take a minute to completely stop the expression of crying.\n\nNever getting angry or disappointed when something bad happens? Halfway similar. I\'ve noticed when I get angry is when there\'s something I\'m trying to do something very important and I have to deal with a computerized phone system that keeps making mistakes because it wants me to say something by voice, and I have to yell at it to be clear, and it still gets it wrong again and again, instead of just letting me press buttons. It\'s like they make those phone systems for important services with the intention of torturing people emotionally and messing with their lives. I never get angry that much at people in person. Disappointment is real, but it\'s in my mind. If you meant an emotion, I don\'t know, maybe if it leads to crying more because life is so awful.\n\nNot being able to care about people? No, I care enough to worry, and give people things when they need something. I cry about memories after someone I knew dies.\n\nNot feeling bad about never getting something wanted? Similar, halfway. Since wanting something is just a thought, and there are so many different things that a person could get or do in life, there\'s usually not any bad feeling about it, and I think that\'s the way it\'s supposed to be. However, if I think about how I\'ve missed out on doing certain things that other people almost all do, over so many years, and there seems to be something unfair about it, or some thought that it might never happen for me, then I may cry about it.\n\nNot knowing if one really enjoys activities or not? Similar.\n\nNot getting a ""good job"" feeling from one\'s brain? Similar. What does that even mean though? Do people get feelings from things they do, other than from the results? For instance, if a person cooks something, there can be a feeling from the result: tasting it and it tastes good. There\'s your feeling. Making music, you hear the music and it sounds like music. There\'s your feeling. Drawing, you finish a picture, and it looks like an interesting picture. There\'s your feeling. Why would you even expect anything else?\n\nNot knowing if all this is normal or wrong? Similar.\n\nI\'m sorry about how long this response is. It\'s like usual for me, what else am I going to do? I\'m not sure what I want. This subject of emotions seems important to me, so I write things that long for myself. Why not share it? It seems fair since you posted at a place that takes comments, so maybe you want a comment.', '12': 'First off, even ugly, quiet and boring people can get someone to love them. I have seen many men/women who are considered ""ugly"" walking around with handsome men/women. Sure, they might be the minority, but there\'s still the chance.\n\nThat said, I want to share something that is a bit similar. I have always been a quiet boy and always had only 1 true friend. Around 5 years ago (when I was like 20years old) when I went to a new school, there was a girl who shared similar interests/hobbies like me and after a few months we started talking and walking together to the bus station every day. It had been quite an enjoyable experience for me, having been kinda lonely lots of times and never really had a female friend. Well, after some time (around the time school was finished) she asked me out to some event with her friends and I accepted but when day of the event came, my social anxiety kicked in and I found some random excuses to stay at home. While we still could be considered friends after that I never got the courage to go past just ""talking and walking together"", always scared that I am not worthy/good enough for her. After school finished I pretty much lost contact with her since we never got past ""school friends"". Now I am 25 years old and still have a lonely life and every day I regret being scared and not having the courage to be more than ""school friends"". If you have depression, having regrets makes it way worse.\n\nSo, my advice to you is, while easier said than done, is to make the right choice so that in the future, you won\'t have any regrets.\n\nApart from that, I can\'t really give any better advice since I am not really better than you in this case. The only thing I can think of is that you should ask him why he chose you and if it\'s really fine to go with him to the prom. Basically, try to know more of his thoughts.', '13': 'I understand that therapy may not have been helpful where you went or your therapist wasn\'t a good fit. This has happened to me before. Take a break now if thats what you see fit for yourself but I would encourage you to do some research into different therapists in your area to possibly see if one stands out to you. Ask around too. Each therapist is different and has a different approach, is important to find one thats a good fit for you. Especially if you are/are not religious. Its important to find something that fits you. Alas, therapy may not be for you. Try journalling, self tracking, self help, coping skills, etc. \n\nAs far ad your medications. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE go off of them slowly.

Ended a nearly 2 year relationship, convinced my university I was healed and to be let back in despite academic standing, never needed to sleep, rang up some pretty credit card debt, etc. Its not an experience I would recommend. So cut them in half or something I guess. But you should really refer to your doctor when going off of any meds. \n\nWhen I went on my Wellbutrin 75mg I was not happy about it. I really didnt want to. But I had a great psych that put me on a med thats a better fit than I had before. Ive chosen to stay on it until I\'m through IOP and DBT therapy and feel I am at a stable point in my life to learn to navigate life off of the meds. For now I view it a little bit more as a stabilizer while we are still trying to get everything sorted out. \n\nLook into support groups, they are often less expensive and more open than therapy is. Just a suggestion. \n\n', '14': 'Glad I could help!\n\nNo, I know. That\'s why when I hear of any reunions (whether it\'s someone else\'s making me think of my own coming up one day) I get really anxious because I think about going back to that. And, in a way, for me it\'s also because I feel like I\'m not done becoming who I really want to be and am proud of showing off yet? And, maybe that\'s a little shallow, but it\'s like I\'m not on social media really or it\'s really hidden to where people can\'t track it back to me, and when I went off to college I basically have been on radio silence. When I make myself more ""public"" all around to people (including those from my past maybe) I want to be...""finished""?\n\nAnd I know that\'s a weird, personal hang up and that no one\'s ever really done ""growing"" but I feel so malleable still in every aspect of my life.\n\nThat\'s great to hear! Baby steps, and hey, you had a conversation with someone, that\'s new and you did it! Roots take time to grow, but you\'ll get there.\n\nHaha yeah, we were all absolutely MISERABLE at the time, but looking back, it\'s an amusing story to tell for me now. I think another thing about college, and life in general that I had forgotten until I was typing up that last sentence is that, it\'s partly having that different community to do your growing (less than a year, a year, 2 years, 4 years, etc.), making connections with people for when you get out, and just....having those experiences and stories to look back on in life.\n\nI didn\'t really do a whole lot with my years mainly because I had it hammered home that I needed to just focus on my studies and get out and get a job immediately (VEEEEEEERY unrealistic in many cases) and I was depressed. I\'m glad for the moments I did have and I look back on that with the most fondness. I could\'ve done more, yes, but I try not to ""regret"" my path and I did what I could with getting my depression actually figured out for the first time.\n\nI\'m kind of doing that now in my life. Trying things out and actively looking into what the city has to offer in terms of events/etc. and just trying things. Even if it has to be by myself, I have to be okay with that too. It\'s kind of empowering almost being okay by yourself if it comes to that. Just, also, be safe about it.\n\nTry out some clubs! I never did but for my sister and brother (currently in college) and it seems to be working for them. My brother also is on the autistism spectrum and has severe OCD so his social cues aren\'t the best, but apparently he\'ll just start chatting with people in the public commons area and people seem to react well to that. Which is a relief to me because he was very much bullied up until high school.\n\nAgain, you\'re doing what you can, something will come of it. :)', '15': 'Hey.\n\n\nI am in a rough patch right now, and I want to give you some advice. It\'s better to work on what you can change so you have one less worry of. Alright? For example, I\'m working a 9-to-5 job doing some work that I find utterly meaningless, but what is the alternative? Having no structure in my life, being broke, etc. I\'d rather be depressed over one less thing (money, too much time left to my chaotic thoughts), than over many problems I perceive in my life.\n\n\n""all my passion for instruments and music thrown away"" you are so lucky to be good at music (i\'m sure you are). As much as I have tried, i suck at the piano and am tone deaf. Please work on your music and practice constantly. Structure your daily routine and stick to it, and you will feel better.\n\n\n""im so fat and ugly"" why do you say that? are you really ""fat"" like your BMI is too high, or are you projecting your thoughts like that? some small ways to help yourself is to get into a routine of cooking, reject larger meal portions, eat healthily (if you cook it\'s cheaper). I\'m assuming that since you\'re 15 you have plenty of free time to explore some new hobbies.\n\n\nCollege might be worthless to you right now, but it\'s meaningful for me and a lot of other people. Im not from the US so my college fees aren\'t outrageously expensive, but it\'s a massive privilege to talk to extremely intellectual professors and bounce ideas off each other. It\'s a good time to figure out what you want in life and learn useful skill sets, if you structure your life enough to give you the time to do something meaningful. Otherwise you will fritter your life away.\n\n\nI am aware the tough love and advice approach might not be what you want to hear, you can always rant on Reddit. But you\'re just 15, and I wish I could be 15 again and pick up everything and every skill that I didn\'t take seriously at that point. Watch some of Dr Jordan B Peterson\'s videos on YouTube about depression. They will help you. All the best.', '16': 'So, I have a lot of experience with inpatient. I\'ll write my rather long story below, but keep the helpful stuff up here in case you don\'t want to read it. In short, I will not go back to inpatient due to many issues I had while hospitalized. The mental healthcare in my area is severely lacking, and felt like something out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest. However, you live in a metropolitan area, so I have no doubt your experience will be much better than mine, so **please don\'t let my story prevent you from getting help**. If you feel you are in danger, please go to the best hospital you can afford, go to the ER, and they will handle it from there. It sounds like you could really benefit from being inpatient.\n\n\n\nAnyway, here are my experiences...\n\nI live in NY and have been in three different inpatient facilities. One was an independent center, and the other two were psychiatric wings in hospitals. \n\nI\'ll be completely honest with you, every single time I\'ve been, I beg the doctors to let me out. I thought going would help me, but when I am there it feels like I\'m trapped. I do not feel the facilities I went to helped me in any way, BUT they did keep me alive. \n\n\nHere\'s what you can probably expect if you decide to check yourself in: You will not have control of your day. You will be told when to wake up, when to eat, and when you have to go to ""groups"" (more on those later). You will have some leisure time, but don\'t expect to be able to whip out a book and read whenever you want to. \n\n\nAt the independent center the care was so bad, it was just unreal. I would be given sleep inducing drugs, then get in trouble when I would skip groups to sleep. Which is crazy, considering I was being given benadryl and other things that are known to knock people out. They had a very strict attendance policy for the group sessions, which honestly weren\'t even that helpful since you would go to the same one once a week. It felt like I had no control over my life, not even my own body, since by the time I left I had 10 drugs prescribed to me. By the time I left they had banned me from ever returning. No joke. I was very vocal about my issues, and I guess that was enough to not allow me back. I have tried to check myself in again but every time they say I am not allowed. I ask why, and they say it\'s because I skipped group...for sleeping, when they gave me sleep inducing meds. It makes me angry to think about. When I spoke to a nurse on the phone to figure out why I was banned, she said, ""We didn\'t seem to help you much the last time, so what would be different this time?"" \n\n\nThe hospitals are a much safer bet. If you have dietary issues, make sure you are upfront about it. I was basically given nothing to eat since I was vegetarian and have milk and corn allergies. One of the hospitals didn\'t give me my daily allergy medications because some lazy fuck decided not to write them down, so I had to *actually break down in tears* to get the staff to call a doctor from the ER so I could get my prescriptions. Which I genuinely need since I am allergic to just about everything. If I ever need to go back I know which hospital I will be going to, and it\'s not the one where the orderlies laughed in my face when I was crying and begging for my medicine, which I need to breathe properly.\n\n\nSo, would I recommend it? Yes. Despite everything that has happened to me during inpatient, it will prevent you from killing or harming yourself, which is all that really matters. In my opinion it is basically a step above prison, but I still recommend it if you think you need it. Just don\'t expect to be very comfortable while you\'re there. \n\n\n\n\n', '17': 'Because I am just like you. My sense of training, motivation, and purpose is helping others. It gives me worth, and it helps me Believe that life is different than this feeling I have reinforcing how pointless it is. I find Myself constantly trying to replay banjo kazooie and hoping for the feeling of butterflies I use to get to return but it never does. So I realized I have to move on and find my own butterflies again, and that’s when I realized that instead of looking back at all the good moments that gave me that feeling that every moment really is so special. That moment that your crying and your mom sat there with you til you felt better, how important that was to my development, that something mattered and somebody cared and somebody did something so selfless. That I could be that person to someone, or that there’s someone out there right now feeling exactly like I did but they don’t realize  that it is a pivotal moment because they have something inside them suppressing the idea. \n\nIn a way I think everyone on this thread is the same. We all looked up a way to discuss our inner loneliness without looking crazy to our peers because we intend to give them a sense that we are okay to not make things worse, it’s part of our subconscious crying out for help '}",<b> Here are some relevant good comments for your reference: </b>,click event
