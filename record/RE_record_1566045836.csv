I can understand your feelings but i think maybe you are not focusing on the right thing and maybe that is making you avoid the things you listed and because of that not achieve what you want. The focus of university should not be the goal of having the education it should be focused on a subject you love and hold central to who you are as a person. This is about a lifes work in a subject and not a box to tick and go into whatever. That attitude i believe will set you up to fail especially with depression as you have no solid goal to chase. My love of art is why i am here today and it keeps me from giving up, i think you need to work out what subject really takes hold of you and not something you worry about getting a job with. This is a problem millions of students encounter when they choose a course based on parents, getting a job etc and not following a passion they have. So if i was you i would work that out and ask to change course then focus all your attention on immersing youself in that subject and watch how it changes your attitude to everything else. Also check out mindfulness and zen buddism as they have had a massive impact on my depression. Taking to a therapist can help too if they are doing talking therapy and not just prescribing you drugs. I dropped out of collage 4 times but here i am writing my thesis and i know if i can do it so can you. good luck my friend and i hope you achieve all you desire in life.', '1': 'Exactly this☝️☝️ focus on improving yourself physically and mentally. If you haven’t decided on a career yet I would suggest a STEM field. These are high demand and high reward careers, where you get to teach others and work on teams to innovate and learn new things. Freedom can only be attained through discipline, don’t be fooled by easy answers. It willl be difficult but afterward you will emerge stronger and eventually find intelligent and woman to join you in the game of life.

In my experience knowledge of how our minds work and how our body works helps to get the small things in life correct.\n\nA simple thing such as cloudy weather leads to depression for about 20 percent people. I was also one of them when i realised that my unhappiness is tied to weather. Today it is cold and cloudy and still i am happy. Why? Because knowledge helped me.\n\nSimilar to this, one of the biggest influence is diet. Standard.diet with sugar and carbs makes people fat is low energy and kills happiness like anything. So change your diet.\n\nAnother thing is physical activity. Lethargy kills happiness like anything. So get some endorphins from running and see the change.\n\nFor mind, which keeps.on jumping and the modern gadgets which keep on trapping it, the only way out is mind excercise through meditation. Couple this with cognitive behaviour therapy and beat depression like anything. And dont forget sleep. Without 7 to 8 hours your mind will again be tired\n\nDepression is not one thing. It is many things and you need to take care of your mind and body to make those things ok. Once you take care of them then you will be more energised to take care of the other things.\n\nTake care. Dont worry Be Happy.', '3': ""This may sound weird, but I really enjoyed your post. I know you are down but I think there is a lot of good in your life. For some people that is inspirational as it is a reminder that depression and mental disorders can affect anyone at any time. \n\n\nNot being bipolar myself, I am sure there is pain attached that I don't see. That said, I think your long term struggles may really be a strength in some ways. Many people fall into depression when they hit a wall after a long term manic episode. Not so say we are all bipolar, but everyone had ups and downs. Hopefully, and I assume owning a successful  buisness and finding love are indicators, you have the ability to detect you mood and energy. Many people fall far deeper into depression simply because they dont recognize the rut. We all can forget from time to time, that these are just low points and there will be a more elevated mood coming soon. So try not to forget that yourself. The pain you are feeling will pass. Things get better.\n\nOn the note of feeling suicidal. It sounds to me like you feel trapped. You have a successful buisness that you think you are better staying in but you are tired of maybe the consistant work load. Your husband is a wonderful guy, but some of the spark and energy is gone. So you are in duality of constantly thinking: should I stay or should I go. Thinking on this constantly can be so exhausting that it seems like the easiest choice is to end your pain. But that is not rational anymore. Obviously everyone around you will be worse off with you dead than if you chose to separate from one or both.\n\nI have two recommendations to help.\n\nFirst, if you are not seeing a therapist or counselor, I would suggest discussing your issues with one. Hopefully they can help you root out your desires and choose a path forward.\n\nSecond, I would try journaling your feelings. Personally, I think a pro and con list could be damaging, so I would just focus on what your mind is thinking, and write that down. Instead of keeping your thoughts in your head it helps you to get out ideas without judgement or anguish. Write in your phone or a computer if you dont like the idea of pen to paper. \n\nI hope this helps. \n\nAs a personal afternote, I am a 29M and married. A few months ago I had some personal drama going on and found telling my wife I loved her as I walked out the door and feeling like I was lying. I felt aweful and guilty and confused. Much like you, my partner loves me and wants a future and honestly there are few things I could find to be negative about with her. \n\nFeeling disconnected from her, I started considering all the things I disliked of her. I found basically 5 things in my life that I was not happy about. Some were directly related to her, others where just in my head. This lead to talking. Me discussing with her and admitting I was in a negative place. I never told her that I didnt think I loved her, but communicated all the other issues and a feeling of disconnect. Relationships require communicating our feelings with our partners. \n\nWe worked on some things, but ultimately i have discovered that my appriciation with her is much more about me than her or anyone else. When we like ourselves and our life and accept ourselves, we like those in our lives an appriciate them more. I won't say i am not occasionally still disconnected from her, but we have had a great couple of days lately, and she is at work now while I am at home. I can say I miss her and love her and it is an honest change from just a few months ago.\n\nFor me at least, life is fucking weird and sometimes you have to roll through the bad to get back to the good. It's like following a GPS down a shitty road. The GPS may have you on it for miles but once you realize you dont like the road and you want off, it may require a detour and some driving down the same road, but the sooner you realize, the sooner you can find an improvement. Killing yourself would just be a crash on a shitty road. That is no way to end this trip.\n\nGood luck and I hope this helps. Sorry for such a long post. \n"", '4': 'Give yourself time my friend. My brothers both died before i was born, but hey life has always been affected their deaths. My father developed PTSD and is quite a nervous and angry man still.  They died at age 25 both.

If you need closure then get it somehow. i will go on a quest to find out all i can about my brothers and get closure. Stay strong.

I regret it to this day that I was such a bitch about school and didn't just man up and put in the work to finish my last year despite knowing I was probably unemployable. I just didn't want to suffer anymore. But guess what? not having that degree after 3 years of work puts you in the same place as a high school drop out nowadays. The fact that you made is 3 years in a computer science degree says you don't belong at McDonald's. Don't stress about the gpa and just focus on doing your best and passing the classes and have your degree. It's in computer science so I wouldn't worry job prospects. Just think that you'll be putting your ENTIRE academic career at risk by quitting. From preschool all the way to highschool and the 3 years you've been in college. You've come too far man to let it all be for nothing. Even if you fail and it will take longer to finish KEEP GOING KEEP TRYING. Quitting cold turkey like I did will fucking haunt you like it's been haunting me. Just take all those shitty thoughts and ignore them and focus 100% on school. Stay strong brother"", '6': 'You are certainly not alone. And you are certainly dealing with (in my opinion, but its fact) one of the hardest, soul crushing, impossible to fully comprehend diseases you can get. Thats the reason talking to others that know can be the only relief from the extreme isolation and loneliness you feel regardless of how many people are around. It\'s an intense fight and even those who are in really deep at the moment. You are here, you are reading, you sometimes post and God dammit you are FIGHTING it. I have type 1 diabetes, got 90% of my colon removed when I was a kid so at 32 I\'m still in constant pain. Yet I would double those ailments if it meant I could have my life back with the 18 years of depression/anxiety/self-hatred wiped away. \n\nIt\'s that bad, and understandably hard to grasp if your preconceived notion of depression is having 1 bad day at the office.\n\nWe all need to have a huge discussion about the stigmatism polarized in a society that makes people in such bad shape feel ashamed and crazy because shit terms like ""mental health"" get thrown around like it\'s saying hello! I thought this was the era where progressive acceptance of taboo issues is to be fought for and understood in a more broad sense.\n\nThen why the FUCK is depression and mental health as a whole, one of the biggest underlying factors in so much shit that goes undiagnosed and creates habits or bad situations in literally all facets of life. Not only is it downplayed by media, shows, articles and soap box critics who need to insert a shitty false and triggering opinion they have no business talking about like its nothing. It\'s looked at in a negative light! No fucking WONDER more people don\'t seek treatment. \n\nI\'m going to write a huge article eventually trying to prop up this harmful group think of ignorant keyboard critics that let ego and lack of common sense destroy others without even knowing. A shift in society to support and learn about how devastating this could save so many lives I believe. Fighting this for so long now and meeting so many like us one topic always comes up. *We just want to be understood, and not looked at like some lying, lazy burden.* We all need more understanding and a voice that people respect when we try to tell them how we feel. With no interjections about their version of why we are the way we are. Just respect me trying to explain why I am the way I am, leave it at that AND THINK ABOUT IT. Give me some fucking compassion like I give you even though some weeks I can\'t get out of bed and you guilt me 100 times a moth. \n\nI love all you going through the struggle. We are all in this together, and we need to stick together and fight this. We need a voice, we need to be outraged its just accepted in this manner and IT NEEDS TO FUCKING CHANGE. Irregardless of the internet and me not knowing anyone here personally, I can gurentee you I probably could relate with you 99% better than most people I\'m close to in my life.\n\nI will keep fighting so long as everyone else does. We are worth it. We really fucking are.', '7': 'Hey, wow do I feel this post...  I\'ll be a senior in high school this fall and have no idea wtf I\'m still doing here sometimes.  Sometimes I think really similar things like how I\'ll never get into any college even though everyone around me thinks otherwise since I get good grades.  In those moments it\'s sometimes helpful to remind myself that I\'m thinking very emotionally and not necessarily rationally.  Anxiety\'s a lying bitch and depression is it\'s shitty sidekick.  \n\nI\'m sorry that your family doesn\'t really accept your depression.  It sounds like they\'re only adding lot of stress when they ideally would give the most support.  Just try and remember that your feelings are valid and real even if they come from less rational thoughts.  You may not get into your dream college (though I\'m starting to think there\'s no such thing), but you WILL get into A college (if that\'s where you want to go).  If the kid in my school who got arrested for driving drunk, high, and without his learner\'s permit past curfew can get accepted with a 2.9 GPA and ""selling weed"" as his only extracurricular, we can too.\n\nThe world is a terrifying place, but sometimes it helps to know that everyone else is pretty terrified as well, even if they don\'t seem like it.  There\'s always going to be something to stress about.  And sometimes life doesn\'t get a whole lot better, at least not quickly.  But I think that we all eventually learn how to cope better to overcome it.  \n\nLastly, I promise you that suicide sucks.  Take it from someone who\'s tried 7 times...  It\'s truly terrifying, anxiety inducing, and painful on every level.  My family was wrecked, and even after years of turmoil, I know I hurt and scared them deeply...\n\nYou won\'t be stuck in this acne-filled, panicky stage forever.

What\'s just one more day?', '8': ""I've been an introvert for a big part of my life (not a hardcore one too ) I had friends just like you, but socializing with people for me was just meh. Went and still going through depression during uni, and oh boy when you are an introvert and dealing with depression, you just feel like the only one living in this world and nobody else is responding no matter what you do. My introversion was also the reason I've never got to have a girlfriend, as socializing with people is just too much for me and the fact that you might end up with the wrong person or someone that will emotionally hurt you. It was just unnecessary for me. It's really hard to convince someone who went through alot to stay strong and keep fighting all these problems. But honestly no matter how little the things, you still hold on to, are. Just keep your head up, try filling your schedule because if you leave yourself to your own thoughts it's gonna consume you. I've been procrastinating alot and just being lazy because of what I went through, but I'm trying as well to change it. Just try and never give up !"", '9': ""My advice is to try to not put so much pressure on yourself and try to forgive yourself. We are living in a time that lots of us young people (yes! you are still young!!! and have lots ahead of you!!!!!) struggle finacially and everyone has a different timeline to stand on their feet. Just take your sweet time! Try not to compare yourself to others and think you are a loser, ok? &lt;3 And I know it's very hard to live with parents who just don't get you - but when I was in your situation, I would take some comfort in the thought that there is someone who loves me and supports me no matter what. But not too much comfort of course, if you know what I mean, to not settle in that situation forever. Maybe that will work for you. Anyway, even if it's easy to forget sometimes - you are young!!! Your life is before you, not behind you!!!! That's what someone told me when I was around your age and it helped me move forward a great deal.\n\nAs for my story. Not living anymore, but I am working with one of my parents to help them get their act together financially and keep our failing business afloat. I also thought this way would be convenient. It is, but it's also one of the major factors that contributed to my depression. I love my parent to bits, but I feel like I'm lighting myself on fire to keep others warm. I'm suffocating. And of course I'm too depressed to look into alternatives. It's a cycle... Like I said, I love my parent but they are also depressed, guilt trip me a lot etc etc. I used to BOTH live and work with them (so I really know how it is - and it was until 26 years old for me) and I was going completely insane. I'm grateful to my partner who moved here from far away to live with me. But now he is also very unhappy in this shithole, which in turn makes me feel more guilty and depressed. FML.

I've asked my friends about this and they also feel as if everyone around them is so much better and when compared to the people surrounding them, they feel worthless. If you just think about your problems and how to solve them, you might be able to fix them and prove to them that you are working hard for them. \n\nEg. If you struggling to find a job, look for some ones online and try to put you mind to it. If you focus for long enough, you will eventually get one! These small steps for your future will make your parents extremely happy and proud for your progress and effort!\n\nIf you believe that you are an utter waste to those around you just think about yourself individually. Don't compare yourself to anyone else for a minute and think of all the magic you've brought your parents like your first steps or you passing a difficult test that they didn't expect.\n\nLife is so tough, especially when your surrounded by people whose lives aren't. Give your problems time and a little effort and they will be resolved. Your parents will always think that your amazing for all the happiness that you have given them and I reckon that they realise what you're going through. They know that one day you will eventually succeed and make them as  proud as you've always wanted them to be and I hope you realize that too.\n\nStay strong, your parents will love you no matter what.

That's so young! In just a few years you will look back and think how you were such a baby. Not in a negative way, but you'll feel bad for having been so hard on yourself if you were. \n\nRelationships are nice but also they are not meant to fill you up entirely. Find your worth in yourself first and eventually the friendships and relationships will come. If you can, keep challenging yourself to meet new people and try new experiences. Lots of people, as they grow older, find it's more and more difficult to have close friends anymore just because everyone is so busy. Some day, everyone's going to be at the same place.\n\nFor now, work on your interests and work on yourself. Keep making new acquaintances - every friendship has to start from somewhere. Invest and make time for certain people if you think they are ones worth developing a deeper relationship with. But in my opinion, don't put any expectation in finding a romantic relationship just yet, because you want to have your outside support system first. It's a lot of pressure to put the expectation on just one person to come fix your loneliness and add excitement to your life. \n\nYou're so young. You're gonna change so much in just the next few years, and as long as you're challenging yourself every day, the people you see and spend time with are going to change a lot, too.\n\nDon't worry :) Everybody's lonely.

It sucks knowing that there is no cure for what we have and the treatment is so based in trial and error. I feel like I will have to be medicated for life. I still feel like people really don't understand depression if it is not something they deal with personally. I hate social media because it is esentially a highlight reel of all the good things happening in the lives of others. It is my personal tendency, and probably many others as well to compare ourself to others. I got rid of facebook for that reason and only have reddit. I can't stand that I am almost 30, not engaged or married, no kids, have a master's degree (that I busted my ass for) and still make less than 40k a year. I can't afford to do anything I want to do because I live alone and have no supplemental income. I am slowly beginning to realize that maybe some of those things aren't for me. I don't think I ever want kids because I would never want to knowingly bring someone into the world who would have a chance of feeling this way. But you know what? It is ok. Celebrate small successes. Find happiness in little things. My depression worsens in the winter and I love houseplants because they are alive and beautiful (when I feel dead and empty inside) and give me something to care for. Suicide is something I think of often because of my fucked up brain, but I know it is never the answer. I used to rely on alcohol and cigarettes as a form of self-medication. I have been quit smoking for 2 years (after 7 failed, but true attempts). I don't really drink anymore. Take care of your body since you only have one. I have watched someone I loved deeply suffer from lung cancer and that would be an incredibly miserable fate. You are capable of more than you know. You are worth more than you know. You are here on earth for some purpose. Science has shown that if we begin trying to think positively (even if we are faking those positive thoughts or smiles) and we do it long enough, it begins to trick our brain into actually beliving in these positive thoughts. Fake it till you make it, basically. I am still trying to work on this, and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder about 10 years ago. You can get help and it will get better, but you must want it. I wish it could go away for you, but we both know it can't. It can be managed and will get better. Stay strong. Take care of yourself. Not sure where you live, but in the US, self-wellness certainly does not seem to be valued, in my experience and opinion. Make time for it for yourself. In the meantime, know that all of those annoying happy people also have their own demons that they might not publicize."", '13': 'I tried to analyze your text, and commenting on some things. Check it out if you want \\^\\^\n\nIf we would sum the text up, you could say that the deciding factors which kept you in this pessimistic and downleading spiral, were:\n\n1. Fighting the depression *alone.*\n\nThis is something that I have reflected upon as well. Having this burden of feeling of not being enough to anyone, or that you do not get any acknowledgement, is just horrible. It is downright depressing being the guy that compares his life with others. Because, no matter how you compare yourself with anyone else, I have learned that you ALWAYS LOSE. For me at least, because I compare my bad sides with everyone elses\' good. \n\n2. There was a lack of hobbies / interests\n\nNow, this for me is a difficult question because I am having a hard time finding things that amuse me. Note that I am not depressed, but I have very few real interests that lets my passion burn for what it is. And, honestly I do not know how to deal with this. It\'s just hard. Really, but as long as we strive for something better, I can just hope that we find something that fulfills us one day.\n\n3. Lack of purpose\n\nI think the crucial factor here to why we lack purpose, is that our society is built upon materialistic needs. We work, to buy. To consume, and to sleep. We lack the culture of Eastern civilization, aka, spirituality. Now, if you are an athiest, then you can take this with a grain of salt since depression does not work well with religion. Been there, done that, after all. But I believe finding meaning from within you, like trying to find hobbies and people to share your life with, is what will give you purpose. Maybe not directly, but with time, it could turn out to become a ""fake it till you make it"" solution. It is the root of depression that we want to get rid of right, and you obviously already have started to work with yourself. Yet, **and you should remember this:** you might have self reflected your whole life, but if you only Q and A yourself, then a lot of good theorizing might become lost. \n\nAlso even if you are in the darkest depths of hell where darkness suffocates you, there is a small light and the light can only be found in two things: You. *Or,* someone else. Peace and love. Jaaam', '14': 'You can push through the next few weeks. It is soooo good you have gotten an appointment that is literally the first step to take. You realize you need help and to talk to someone for that help so that is another step you have completed!!!! You are not lazy at all. I totally understand what you mean. There are days where I am literally paralyzed by my brain. It’s hard to explain the feelings I get but they’re terrible to say the least. We all have our stories and struggles and anxieties and things that stress us out. Everyone’s problems are different just like everyone’s path. Try not to compare yourself to others because you are so uniquely you. You’re still successful and smart and motivated sometimes our brains just need another way to chill. \n\nYou’re on the right path. I am sorry there is nothing I can really say to make you feel better in the moment. I don’t know you personally but you’re taking responsibility for yourself and taking care of yourself and that is the most important thing in your life right now. A lot of people will never understand, and that is okay, not everyone needs to understand. If there is someone in your life you think would maybe hear you out maybe hang with them in meantime but tread lightly I guess ? Idk the people in your life but I am sure there are people that DO care about you, even if you think they don’t. \n\nAlways try therapy before medication btw always good to see if you can do it on your own!

I study physics at university, and haven't performed well in my past two years.

Tons of people get kicked out and go on to complete their degrees later and have decent/good/amazing lives.\n\n&gt; I have put all my focus on my exams (which I passed comfortably), but not as much towards my coursework.\n\nIt's also great that you're identifying where you may have gone a bit off. This is also something I struggle with a lot -- doing poorly because a large chunk of my grade is from coursework. I don't really have any advice for that though, because I haven't figured it out myself. I find that trying to make a list of three things I want to do everyday helps. One thing to help with my mental health. One for my physical health. And one thing which I need to do for other reasons (e.g. school work).\n\nAs for telling your parents. Perhaps you can talk to an academic adviser (as suggested earlier) prior to talking with them so you have more information. If they have always been somewhat supportive, it's likely that they will still be supportive now, even if they are a bit disappointed/upset.\n\nJust remember to figure out all your options, and do your best to think objectively about those options. Sincerely hoping stuff works out for you dude."", '16': ""We all do.  We are all broken in some way.  I truly believe depression is (in my case) a hereditary neurochemical problem.  That is what is really broken.  The self hate and loathing is a manifestation of that.  Objectively I know I am not the loser I think I am.  But my emotions just head down at the slightest trigger and I get wrapped in a self defeating cycle of negative emotions and self talk.  \n\nOn clearer days it is obvious that I am no worse than most people, in fact I'm comparatively OK.  The problem is not who or what I am, or where I am in life, it is the depression-fueled opinions I form about them.  In some ways knowing this makes things worse - why am I so mentally weak that I cannot use the logic and knowledge to change my emotions?  Sometimes the only thing that helps is knowing that the dark clouds will pass eventually and the sun will break through again, even if only for a short time.  \n\nI just joined this group today. I'm hoping engaging in this community will help a bit, and hopefully I might help others at some point."", '17': 'I try to tell myself and my SO that people take stages of life at different times or in different orders. Most of my friends have children at 24. A third went directly into the workforce and I know a handful that got some kind of degree by now.\n\nI just remind myself that I\'m not at the worst place of my life. I try to take literally one day at a time and get a handful of things accomplished and then do some nice stuff for myself.\n\nI struggle with putting things off a lot. I know I do. So I try to get as much energy as possible (lots of sleep, energy drinks, throwing an inner dance party) and get shit done. That way I don\'t have to worry about my weakness- CAUSE EVERYTHING FOR THE DAY IS DONE.\n\nObviously this doesn\'t work every time but I try to set myself up to win instead of setting myself up to fail. Like getting 2 hrs of sleep- I know I won\'t be productive at all if I do this so I set alarms to let me know when to sleep and I stay with it. (Also can\'t over sleep though lol)\n\nMy SO has trouble with last minute plans and hates feeling trapped. He is working on it still- but looks are a big thing for him. So I try to remind him to groom the day before a scheduled event. That way from the time he wakes up until he absolutely has to go- everything is done and he can rock back and forth like the anxiety ridden hedgehog he is and calm himself down to do said planned thing.\n\nI\'m his hype man too. I am great as being positive- I\'m just not always responsible! :D   So he tells me ""no bad BlueNightmares, go to work"" and I tell him ""SHIT BRO YOUR HAIR LOOKS SICK"" and stuff.\n\nI try to remind ourselves that we are going to have fuck up days but its important we make an honest effort at least.

I can understand your feelings but i think maybe you are not focusing on the right thing and maybe that is making you avoid the things you listed and because of that not achieve what you want. The focus of university should not be the goal of having the education it should be focused on a subject you love and hold central to who you are as a person. This is about a lifes work in a subject and not a box to tick and go into whatever. That attitude i believe will set you up to fail especially with depression as you have no solid goal to chase. My love of art is why i am here today and it keeps me from giving up, i think you need to work out what subject really takes hold of you and not something you worry about getting a job with. This is a problem millions of students encounter when they choose a course based on parents, getting a job etc and not following a passion they have. So if i was you i would work that out and ask to change course then focus all your attention on immersing youself in that subject and watch how it changes your attitude to everything else. Also check out mindfulness and zen buddism as they have had a massive impact on my depression. Taking to a therapist can help too if they are doing talking therapy and not just prescribing you drugs.

Keep fighting! \U0001f91f⚔️🗡', '2': ""This may sound weird, but I really enjoyed your post. I know you are down but I think there is a lot of good in your life. For some people that is inspirational as it is a reminder that depression and mental disorders can affect anyone at any time. \n\n\nNot being bipolar myself, I am sure there is pain attached that I don't see. That said, I think your long term struggles may really be a strength in some ways. Many people fall into depression when they hit a wall after a long term manic episode. Not so say we are all bipolar, but everyone had ups and downs. Hopefully, and I assume owning a successful  buisness and finding love are indicators, you have the ability to detect you mood and energy. Many people fall far deeper into depression simply because they dont recognize the rut. We all can forget from time to time, that these are just low points and there will be a more elevated mood coming soon. So try not to forget that yourself. The pain you are feeling will pass. Things get better.\n\nOn the note of feeling suicidal. It sounds to me like you feel trapped. You have a successful buisness that you think you are better staying in but you are tired of maybe the consistant work load. Your husband is a wonderful guy, but some of the spark and energy is gone. So you are in duality of constantly thinking: should I stay or should I go. Thinking on this constantly can be so exhausting that it seems like the easiest choice is to end your pain. But that is not rational anymore. Obviously everyone around you will be worse off with you dead than if you chose to separate from one or both.\n\nI have two recommendations to help.\n\nFirst, if you are not seeing a therapist or counselor, I would suggest discussing your issues with one. Hopefully they can help you root out your desires and choose a path forward.\n\nSecond, I would try journaling your feelings. Personally, I think a pro and con list could be damaging, so I would just focus on what your mind is thinking, and write that down. Instead of keeping your thoughts in your head it helps you to get out ideas without judgement or anguish. Write in your phone or a computer if you dont like the idea of pen to paper. \n\nI hope this helps. \n\nAs a personal afternote, I am a 29M and married. A few months ago I had some personal drama going on and found telling my wife I loved her as I walked out the door and feeling like I was lying. I felt aweful and guilty and confused. Much like you, my partner loves me and wants a future and honestly there are few things I could find to be negative about with her. \n\nFeeling disconnected from her, I started considering all the things I disliked of her. I found basically 5 things in my life that I was not happy about. Some were directly related to her, others where just in my head. This lead to talking. Me discussing with her and admitting I was in a negative place. I never told her that I didnt think I loved her, but communicated all the other issues and a feeling of disconnect. Relationships require communicating our feelings with our partners. \n\nWe worked on some things, but ultimately i have discovered that my appriciation with her is much more about me than her or anyone else. When we like ourselves and our life and accept ourselves, we like those in our lives an appriciate them more. I won't say i am not occasionally still disconnected from her, but we have had a great couple of days lately, and she is at work now while I am at home. I can say I miss her and love her and it is an honest change from just a few months ago.\n\nFor me at least, life is fucking weird and sometimes you have to roll through the bad to get back to the good. It's like following a GPS down a shitty road. The GPS may have you on it for miles but once you realize you dont like the road and you want off, it may require a detour and some driving down the same road, but the sooner you realize, the sooner you can find an improvement. Killing yourself would just be a crash on a shitty road. That is no way to end this trip.\n\nGood luck and I hope this helps. Sorry for such a long post. \n"", '3': 'You got.it right when you say your mind does not allow you to be happy. In my experience knowledge of how our minds work and how our body works helps to get the small things in life correct.\n\nA simple thing such as cloudy weather leads to depression for about 20 percent people. I was also one of them when i realised that my unhappiness is tied to weather. Today it is cold and cloudy and still i am happy. Why? Because knowledge helped me.\n\nSimilar to this, one of the biggest influence is diet. Standard.diet with sugar and carbs makes people fat is low energy and kills happiness like anything. So change your diet.\n\nAnother thing is physical activity. Lethargy kills happiness like anything. So get some endorphins from running and see the change.\n\nFor mind, which keeps.on jumping and the modern gadgets which keep on trapping it, the only way out is mind excercise through meditation. Couple this with cognitive behaviour therapy and beat depression like anything. And dont forget sleep. Without 7 to 8 hours your mind will again be tired\n\nDepression is not one thing. It is many things and you need to take care of your mind and body to make those things ok. Once you take care of them then you will be more energised to take care of the other things.\n\nTake care.

Yes I know unoriginal content, I\'m hating myself for not being able to think. But I can always listen that\'s what I like to best. Anyway I hope even some of this helps. \n\n""Ugh... I\'m so sorry for what you are going through, nobody should have to feel that way. This is way too relatable it\'s unbearably scary for me. I know someone that did exactly this to me. I feel for you on the pain of knowing that they can be so carefree and talk to everyone else yet when it comes to someone that they loved they won\'t even say a word. It\'s the hardest feeling to overcome rejection, especially from someone you put all your heart and soul into.\n\nThe only way I overcame it was by accepting that us, our minds, forgive people so much more quickly, that we know as humans we are all going through this pain and suffering together and that life is about connection. The way I saw it is that perhaps your partners mind, I know my friends mind was, way different in the way it saw life. That somethings take ages for them to overcome, that space is all they need to process these emotions as they aren\'t in touch with them, like we are. That it takes longer for them to forgive but you can\'t force them to say those words or make them friend you. That isn\'t a healthy friendship.\n\nI understand completely your jealousy and that\'s fine to feel. As for me I felt it was acceptable because I wanted their input, their connection to feel happy. And seeing them on social media talking to others will do that. Ignore what they do and focus on what you want to do. Understand that your happiness isn\'t dependent on them being in your life. This has taken me way too long to figure out. That I am capable of doing other things such as helping people on Reddit, arts and crafts, gardening, cooking and walking, without them. These things bring me happiness and make me, me. Find the things you enjoy in life and attract new people into your life. I always feel like people can sense the vibes you put off into the world so send out the vibes of the people you want to attract in your life.\n\nAt the end of the day, your partner could care for you or not. I can\'t mind read but tell him you respect his decisions, that you don\'t want to hurt him and you do love him. This can help bring acceptance to you by understanding and accepting your emotions while at the same time justifying his agenda. But don\'t obsess over him, that only does no good and don\'t make him obsess over you either, that isn\'t healthy. These words and this stage may take ages to come by as it did for me, but once it does it brings nothing but peace to your life. It takes ages like I said and everyone\'s interpretation of peace is different so make it the way you want it to be.\n\nJust know that the way your partner has treated you isn\'t seemingly obvious of the way a friend should treat you, but don\'t blame yourself on this one. Don\'t say you were the cause for change in the relationship rather that minds and feelings change for people over time. It\'s a hard part about life and can make you feel like that you don\'t want to live but trust me, it can get better. It\'s really hard to contain these emotions but give yourself time. Try to write somethings you are grateful for and vow to thank them for being in your life everyday. This is the first step to living a content life.\n\nAt the end of the day. Reflect back on those memories from the past six years and recognise all the beautiful moments and times spent. Know that is part of your life and you can be happy over that. To only regret not having that back doesn\'t bring change in your life. That is what life is about constant changes, it is only lived by tiny changes. It has taken me so long to figure all of this out it is insane, but after so much reading and understanding I can finally come to rest with myself and I hope you do to.\n\nThe path to recovery is a long one. Emotions will come in waves and there will be bad days, but don\'t let those emotions dictate who you want to be. Put a smile on someone else\'s face during those days. Tip the local coffee person, or just enjoy sometime in a park respecting nature or even compliment a stranger or loved on. Know that you are surrounded by people who love you dearly because that is all that matters. Not someone who doesn\'t respect you. Even if they come back into your life, don\'t let them rule your emotions or dictate who you want to be. Respect is one thing in a relationship but mental torture shouldn\'t be tolerated. Yes take your time grieving and those waves will slowly dissipate like a water droplet in a lake.\n\nLife takes time, it\'s too short to not do what you want to do. Know you can\'t make someone love you and this will make you happier. You are the most important person in your life. Only you matter and if someone else loves you hold onto them and love them back, but don\'t become dependant on them, that\'s where problems occur. You aren\'t stupid for knowing this the first time we are constantly continuing ourselves with knowledge. The fact you came to Reddit to ask for helps means you want to better yourself.\n\nSorry if it was a long spiel and I sound stupid in somethings I say but this is somethings I have found from life experience. Don\'t be afraid to ask questions. I hope you can find that light inside of you to shine. It takes time but once you do you will be glad for this short life we are afforded in this continuous infinity.""\n\nLook I know it\'s long, it\'s honestly like mostly advice not something that is practical to this sub at best of times.

And you are certainly dealing with (in my opinion, but its fact) one of the hardest, soul crushing, impossible to fully comprehend diseases you can get. Thats the reason talking to others that know can be the only relief from the extreme isolation and loneliness you feel regardless of how many people are around. It\'s an intense fight and even those who are in really deep at the moment. You are here, you are reading, you sometimes post and God dammit you are FIGHTING it. I have type 1 diabetes, got 90% of my colon removed when I was a kid so at 32 I\'m still in constant pain. Yet I would double those ailments if it meant I could have my life back with the 18 years of depression/anxiety/self-hatred wiped away. \n\nIt\'s that bad, and understandably hard to grasp if your preconceived notion of depression is having 1 bad day at the office.\n\nWe all need to have a huge discussion about the stigmatism polarized in a society that makes people in such bad shape feel ashamed and crazy because shit terms like ""mental health"" get thrown around like it\'s saying hello! I thought this was the era where progressive acceptance of taboo issues is to be fought for and understood in a more broad sense.\n\nThen why the FUCK is depression and mental health as a whole, one of the biggest underlying factors in so much shit that goes undiagnosed and creates habits or bad situations in literally all facets of life. Not only is it downplayed by media, shows, articles and soap box critics who need to insert a shitty false and triggering opinion they have no business talking about like its nothing. It\'s looked at in a negative light! No fucking WONDER more people don\'t seek treatment. \n\nI\'m going to write a huge article eventually trying to prop up this harmful group think of ignorant keyboard critics that let ego and lack of common sense destroy others without even knowing. A shift in society to support and learn about how devastating this could save so many lives I believe. Fighting this for so long now and meeting so many like us one topic always comes up. *We just want to be understood, and not looked at like some lying, lazy burden.* We all need more understanding and a voice that people respect when we try to tell them how we feel. With no interjections about their version of why we are the way we are. Just respect me trying to explain why I am the way I am, leave it at that AND THINK ABOUT IT. Give me some fucking compassion like I give you even though some weeks I can\'t get out of bed and you guilt me 100 times a moth. \n\nI love all you going through the struggle. We are all in this together, and we need to stick together and fight this. We need a voice, we need to be outraged its just accepted in this manner and IT NEEDS TO FUCKING CHANGE. Irregardless of the internet and me not knowing anyone here personally, I can gurentee you I probably could relate with you 99% better than most people I\'m close to in my life.\n\nI will keep fighting so long as everyone else does. We are worth it. We really fucking are.', '13': 'I tried to analyze your text, and commenting on some things. Check it out if you want \\^\\^\n\nIf we would sum the text up, you could say that the deciding factors which kept you in this pessimistic and downleading spiral, were:\n\n1. Fighting the depression *alone.*\n\nThis is something that I have reflected upon as well. Having this burden of feeling of not being enough to anyone, or that you do not get any acknowledgement, is just horrible. It is downright depressing being the guy that compares his life with others. Because, no matter how you compare yourself with anyone else, I have learned that you ALWAYS LOSE. For me at least, because I compare my bad sides with everyone elses\' good. \n\n2. There was a lack of hobbies / interests\n\nNow, this for me is a difficult question because I am having a hard time finding things that amuse me. Note that I am not depressed, but I have very few real interests that lets my passion burn for what it is. And, honestly I do not know how to deal with this. It\'s just hard. Really, but as long as we strive for something better, I can just hope that we find something that fulfills us one day.\n\n3. Lack of purpose\n\nI think the crucial factor here to why we lack purpose, is that our society is built upon materialistic needs. We work, to buy. To consume, and to sleep. We lack the culture of Eastern civilization, aka, spirituality. Now, if you are an athiest, then you can take this with a grain of salt since depression does not work well with religion. Been there, done that, after all. But I believe finding meaning from within you, like trying to find hobbies and people to share your life with, is what will give you purpose. Maybe not directly, but with time, it could turn out to become a ""fake it till you make it"" solution. It is the root of depression that we want to get rid of right, and you obviously already have started to work with yourself. Yet, **and you should remember this:** you might have self reflected your whole life, but if you only Q and A yourself, then a lot of good theorizing might become lost. \n\nAlso even if you are in the darkest depths of hell where darkness suffocates you, there is a small light and the light can only be found in two things: You. *Or,* someone else. Peace and love. Jaaam', '14': 'Hey, wow do I feel this post...  I\'ll be a senior in high school this fall and have no idea wtf I\'m still doing here sometimes.  Sometimes I think really similar things like how I\'ll never get into any college even though everyone around me thinks otherwise since I get good grades.  In those moments it\'s sometimes helpful to remind myself that I\'m thinking very emotionally and not necessarily rationally.  Anxiety\'s a lying bitch and depression is it\'s shitty sidekick.  \n\nI\'m sorry that your family doesn\'t really accept your depression.  It sounds like they\'re only adding lot of stress when they ideally would give the most support.  Just try and remember that your feelings are valid and real even if they come from less rational thoughts.  You may not get into your dream college (though I\'m starting to think there\'s no such thing), but you WILL get into A college (if that\'s where you want to go).  If the kid in my school who got arrested for driving drunk, high, and without his learner\'s permit past curfew can get accepted with a 2.9 GPA and ""selling weed"" as his only extracurricular, we can too.\n\nThe world is a terrifying place, but sometimes it helps to know that everyone else is pretty terrified as well, even if they don\'t seem like it.  There\'s always going to be something to stress about.  And sometimes life doesn\'t get a whole lot better, at least not quickly.  But I think that we all eventually learn how to cope better to overcome it.  \n\nLastly, I promise you that suicide sucks.  Take it from someone who\'s tried 7 times...  It\'s truly terrifying, anxiety inducing, and painful on every level.  My family was wrecked, and even after years of turmoil, I know I hurt and scared them deeply...\n\nYou won\'t be stuck in this acne-filled, panicky stage forever.  Things can and definitely will change in one way or another.  You\'ve made it this far.  What\'s just one more day?', '15': ""&gt;pretend to be happy long enough and eventually you will be.\n\nThis is so stupid. This is exactly how I have kept making my depression worse, although I was a bit more radical and denied myself pretty much having any feelings at all. It can help to try focus on the good things in life, but denying your own pain is really bad (in my non professional opinion).\n\nCan you see a professional somehow? A good therapist will listen to you and support you, not feed you silly stuff like that but rather provide tailored options how you can make steps to improving your situation. Medication might also help you. I think it's important you take these warning signs (thinking about another attempt) seriously, and take precautions. For example save a number of a suicide prevention hotline on your phone. \n\nSocial isolation sucks. Living in a bad place sucks. Debt sucks. It's not things you have to accept indefinitely. All of these things can change again. Maybe short term you have or despair is born. But long term you want to fix these things, and that might contribute to you actually feeling better about your life. There certainly will be people who want to spend their time with you, but it might not work due a multitude of reasons right now."", '16': ""I felt the exact same way once.  I still do sometimes. It sucks knowing that there is no cure for what we have and the treatment is so based in trial and error. I feel like I will have to be medicated for life. I still feel like people really don't understand depression if it is not something they deal with personally. I hate social media because it is esentially a highlight reel of all the good things happening in the lives of others. It is my personal tendency, and probably many others as well to compare ourself to others. I got rid of facebook for that reason and only have reddit. I can't stand that I am almost 30, not engaged or married, no kids, have a master's degree (that I busted my ass for) and still make less than 40k a year. I can't afford to do anything I want to do because I live alone and have no supplemental income. I am slowly beginning to realize that maybe some of those things aren't for me. I don't think I ever want kids because I would never want to knowingly bring someone into the world who would have a chance of feeling this way. But you know what? It is ok. Celebrate small successes. Find happiness in little things. My depression worsens in the winter and I love houseplants because they are alive and beautiful (when I feel dead and empty inside) and give me something to care for. Suicide is something I think of often because of my fucked up brain, but I know it is never the answer. I used to rely on alcohol and cigarettes as a form of self-medication. I have been quit smoking for 2 years (after 7 failed, but true attempts). I don't really drink anymore. Take care of your body since you only have one. I have watched someone I loved deeply suffer from lung cancer and that would be an incredibly miserable fate. You are capable of more than you know. You are worth more than you know. You are here on earth for some purpose. Science has shown that if we begin trying to think positively (even if we are faking those positive thoughts or smiles) and we do it long enough, it begins to trick our brain into actually beliving in these positive thoughts. Fake it till you make it, basically. I am still trying to work on this, and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder about 10 years ago. You can get help and it will get better, but you must want it. I wish it could go away for you, but we both know it can't. It can be managed and will get better. Stay strong. Take care of yourself. Not sure where you live, but in the US, self-wellness certainly does not seem to be valued, in my experience and opinion. Make time for it for yourself. In the meantime, know that all of those annoying happy people also have their own demons that they might not publicize."", '17': ""I miswrote that on accident actually. For a couple weeks I've fixed in my mind to do it tomorrow on Sunday at a specific time, I don't know why I wrote tomorrow last night. \n\nDo I want to live? Yes. Define living though. In my opinion living is only really living if you have the color of emotions in your life which I lost many years ago. Something which is impossible to regain. Find a hobby and enjoy it? Sure, the second half of that is where the real trouble comes though. I can't physically enjoy it, regardless of how interesting or fun it seems like it should be to me. Take in nature? I do think nature is very beautiful. I can't physically enjoy being in it though.\n\nI'm not sure if you can comprehend this concept if you haven't lost your emotions. I took them for granted. There is actually emotion attached to everything, you always feel it wherever you are and I distinctly remember it even though I only remember feeling it in elementary school. It really colors your life. But now that I've lost the ability to feel emotion? I can't feel a damn thing. Take for instance a couple weeks ago. Went on a date with this beautiful girl and we held hands and danced. But I felt nothing. And I remember what love felt like, it was extremely powerful. I felt like I should love this girl for a multitude of reasons but I just didn't *feel* it. Dancing with her should've been special, but emotionally it felt the same as doing any other mundane thing in life like taking out the trash or working. I'm so numb nothing feels different. For this reason I can't enjoy anything I used to, not hobbies, not being with friends, not anything at all. I felt more joy years ago when my life was shit than I do now. \n\nAgain I'm not sure you or anyone else can comprehend this without feeling it for yourself. Take it from me though, life is colorless without emotion and everything is the same dull grey regardless of what it is. I cannot physically enjoy anything. There is no joy to be had. Life pales in comparison to what it used to be, and guess what? It used to be a lot shittier just a few years ago, but at least I had emotions.  At least I could have fun doing things. What used to interest me like videogames or drawing which I could do for hours on end, now I can only do for ten minutes max and it's fucking hard to get myself to do it, as if it's some sort of chore.

I can understand your feelings but i think maybe you are not focusing on the right thing and maybe that is making you avoid the things you listed and because of that not achieve what you want. The focus of university should not be the goal of having the education it should be focused on a subject you love and hold central to who you are as a person. This is about a lifes work in a subject and not a box to tick and go into whatever. That attitude i believe will set you up to fail especially with depression as you have no solid goal to chase. My love of art is why i am here today and it keeps me from giving up, i think you need to work out what subject really takes hold of you and not something you worry about getting a job with. This is a problem millions of students encounter when they choose a course based on parents, getting a job etc and not following a passion they have. So if i was you i would work that out and ask to change course then focus all your attention on immersing youself in that subject and watch how it changes your attitude to everything else. Also check out mindfulness and zen buddism as they have had a massive impact on my depression. Taking to a therapist can help too if they are doing talking therapy and not just prescribing you drugs.

Keep fighting! \U0001f91f⚔️🗡', '2': ""This may sound weird, but I really enjoyed your post. I know you are down but I think there is a lot of good in your life. For some people that is inspirational as it is a reminder that depression and mental disorders can affect anyone at any time. \n\n\nNot being bipolar myself, I am sure there is pain attached that I don't see. That said, I think your long term struggles may really be a strength in some ways. Many people fall into depression when they hit a wall after a long term manic episode. Not so say we are all bipolar, but everyone had ups and downs. Hopefully, and I assume owning a successful  buisness and finding love are indicators, you have the ability to detect you mood and energy. Many people fall far deeper into depression simply because they dont recognize the rut. We all can forget from time to time, that these are just low points and there will be a more elevated mood coming soon. So try not to forget that yourself. The pain you are feeling will pass. Things get better.\n\nOn the note of feeling suicidal. It sounds to me like you feel trapped. You have a successful buisness that you think you are better staying in but you are tired of maybe the consistant work load. Your husband is a wonderful guy, but some of the spark and energy is gone. So you are in duality of constantly thinking: should I stay or should I go. Thinking on this constantly can be so exhausting that it seems like the easiest choice is to end your pain. But that is not rational anymore. Obviously everyone around you will be worse off with you dead than if you chose to separate from one or both.\n\nI have two recommendations to help.\n\nFirst, if you are not seeing a therapist or counselor, I would suggest discussing your issues with one. Hopefully they can help you root out your desires and choose a path forward.\n\nSecond, I would try journaling your feelings. Personally, I think a pro and con list could be damaging, so I would just focus on what your mind is thinking, and write that down. Instead of keeping your thoughts in your head it helps you to get out ideas without judgement or anguish. Write in your phone or a computer if you dont like the idea of pen to paper. \n\nI hope this helps. \n\nAs a personal afternote, I am a 29M and married. A few months ago I had some personal drama going on and found telling my wife I loved her as I walked out the door and feeling like I was lying. I felt aweful and guilty and confused. Much like you, my partner loves me and wants a future and honestly there are few things I could find to be negative about with her. \n\nFeeling disconnected from her, I started considering all the things I disliked of her. I found basically 5 things in my life that I was not happy about. Some were directly related to her, others where just in my head. This lead to talking. Me discussing with her and admitting I was in a negative place. I never told her that I didnt think I loved her, but communicated all the other issues and a feeling of disconnect. Relationships require communicating our feelings with our partners. \n\nWe worked on some things, but ultimately i have discovered that my appriciation with her is much more about me than her or anyone else. When we like ourselves and our life and accept ourselves, we like those in our lives an appriciate them more. I won't say i am not occasionally still disconnected from her, but we have had a great couple of days lately, and she is at work now while I am at home. I can say I miss her and love her and it is an honest change from just a few months ago.\n\nFor me at least, life is fucking weird and sometimes you have to roll through the bad to get back to the good. It's like following a GPS down a shitty road. The GPS may have you on it for miles but once you realize you dont like the road and you want off, it may require a detour and some driving down the same road, but the sooner you realize, the sooner you can find an improvement. Killing yourself would just be a crash on a shitty road. That is no way to end this trip.\n\nGood luck and I hope this helps. Sorry for such a long post. \n"", '3': 'You got.it right when you say your mind does not allow you to be happy. In my experience knowledge of how our minds work and how our body works helps to get the small things in life correct.\n\nA simple thing such as cloudy weather leads to depression for about 20 percent people. I was also one of them when i realised that my unhappiness is tied to weather. Today it is cold and cloudy and still i am happy. Why? Because knowledge helped me.\n\nSimilar to this, one of the biggest influence is diet. Standard.diet with sugar and carbs makes people fat is low energy and kills happiness like anything. So change your diet.\n\nAnother thing is physical activity. Lethargy kills happiness like anything. So get some endorphins from running and see the change.\n\nFor mind, which keeps.on jumping and the modern gadgets which keep on trapping it, the only way out is mind excercise through meditation. Couple this with cognitive behaviour therapy and beat depression like anything. And dont forget sleep. Without 7 to 8 hours your mind will again be tired\n\nDepression is not one thing.

Yes I know unoriginal content, I\'m hating myself for not being able to think. But I can always listen that\'s what I like to best. Anyway I hope even some of this helps. \n\n""Ugh... I\'m so sorry for what you are going through, nobody should have to feel that way. This is way too relatable it\'s unbearably scary for me. I know someone that did exactly this to me. I feel for you on the pain of knowing that they can be so carefree and talk to everyone else yet when it comes to someone that they loved they won\'t even say a word. It\'s the hardest feeling to overcome rejection, especially from someone you put all your heart and soul into.\n\nThe only way I overcame it was by accepting that us, our minds, forgive people so much more quickly, that we know as humans we are all going through this pain and suffering together and that life is about connection. The way I saw it is that perhaps your partners mind, I know my friends mind was, way different in the way it saw life. That somethings take ages for them to overcome, that space is all they need to process these emotions as they aren\'t in touch with them, like we are. That it takes longer for them to forgive but you can\'t force them to say those words or make them friend you. That isn\'t a healthy friendship.\n\nI understand completely your jealousy and that\'s fine to feel. As for me I felt it was acceptable because I wanted their input, their connection to feel happy. And seeing them on social media talking to others will do that. Ignore what they do and focus on what you want to do. Understand that your happiness isn\'t dependent on them being in your life. This has taken me way too long to figure out. That I am capable of doing other things such as helping people on Reddit, arts and crafts, gardening, cooking and walking, without them. These things bring me happiness and make me, me. Find the things you enjoy in life and attract new people into your life. I always feel like people can sense the vibes you put off into the world so send out the vibes of the people you want to attract in your life.\n\nAt the end of the day, your partner could care for you or not. I can\'t mind read but tell him you respect his decisions, that you don\'t want to hurt him and you do love him. This can help bring acceptance to you by understanding and accepting your emotions while at the same time justifying his agenda. But don\'t obsess over him, that only does no good and don\'t make him obsess over you either, that isn\'t healthy. These words and this stage may take ages to come by as it did for me, but once it does it brings nothing but peace to your life. It takes ages like I said and everyone\'s interpretation of peace is different so make it the way you want it to be.\n\nJust know that the way your partner has treated you isn\'t seemingly obvious of the way a friend should treat you, but don\'t blame yourself on this one. Don\'t say you were the cause for change in the relationship rather that minds and feelings change for people over time. It\'s a hard part about life and can make you feel like that you don\'t want to live but trust me, it can get better. It\'s really hard to contain these emotions but give yourself time. Try to write somethings you are grateful for and vow to thank them for being in your life everyday. This is the first step to living a content life.\n\nAt the end of the day. Reflect back on those memories from the past six years and recognise all the beautiful moments and times spent. Know that is part of your life and you can be happy over that. To only regret not having that back doesn\'t bring change in your life. That is what life is about constant changes, it is only lived by tiny changes. It has taken me so long to figure all of this out it is insane, but after so much reading and understanding I can finally come to rest with myself and I hope you do to.\n\nThe path to recovery is a long one. Emotions will come in waves and there will be bad days, but don\'t let those emotions dictate who you want to be. Put a smile on someone else\'s face during those days. Tip the local coffee person, or just enjoy sometime in a park respecting nature or even compliment a stranger or loved on. Know that you are surrounded by people who love you dearly because that is all that matters. Not someone who doesn\'t respect you. Even if they come back into your life, don\'t let them rule your emotions or dictate who you want to be. Respect is one thing in a relationship but mental torture shouldn\'t be tolerated. Yes take your time grieving and those waves will slowly dissipate like a water droplet in a lake.\n\nLife takes time, it\'s too short to not do what you want to do. Know you can\'t make someone love you and this will make you happier. You are the most important person in your life. Only you matter and if someone else loves you hold onto them and love them back, but don\'t become dependant on them, that\'s where problems occur. You aren\'t stupid for knowing this the first time we are constantly continuing ourselves with knowledge. The fact you came to Reddit to ask for helps means you want to better yourself.\n\nSorry if it was a long spiel and I sound stupid in somethings I say but this is somethings I have found from life experience. Don\'t be afraid to ask questions. I hope you can find that light inside of you to shine. It takes time but once you do you will be glad for this short life we are afforded in this continuous infinity.""\n\nLook I know it\'s long, it\'s honestly like mostly advice not something that is practical to this sub at best of times. It\'s probably mostly not relatable to what you are going through but I figure there are some points that may peak some interest. The best I can offer is try not to miss school, do that for yourself to better yourself. Please just don\'t hurt yourself, just give yourself some time. I\'m really sorry for what you are going through and I know each break up is different for everyone and I am always happy to listen to whatever may be on your mind going through this rough time. ', '6': ""My advice is to try to not put so much pressure on yourself and try to forgive yourself. We are living in a time that lots of us young people (yes! you are still young!!! and have lots ahead of you!!!!!) struggle finacially and everyone has a different timeline to stand on their feet. Just take your sweet time! Try not to compare yourself to others and think you are a loser, ok? &lt;3 And I know it's very hard to live with parents who just don't get you - but when I was in your situation, I would take some comfort in the thought that there is someone who loves me and supports me no matter what. But not too much comfort of course, if you know what I mean, to not settle in that situation forever. Maybe that will work for you. Anyway, even if it's easy to forget sometimes - you are young!!! Your life is before you, not behind you!!!! That's what someone told me when I was around your age and it helped me move forward a great deal.\n\nAs for my story. Not living anymore, but I am working with one of my parents to help them get their act together financially and keep our failing business afloat. I also thought this way would be convenient. It is, but it's also one of the major factors that contributed to my depression. I love my parent to bits, but I feel like I'm lighting myself on fire to keep others warm. I'm suffocating. And of course I'm too depressed to look into alternatives. It's a cycle... Like I said, I love my parent but they are also depressed, guilt trip me a lot etc etc. I used to BOTH live and work with them (so I really know how it is - and it was until 26 years old for me) and I was going completely insane. I'm grateful to my partner who moved here from far away to live with me. But now he is also very unhappy in this shithole, which in turn makes me feel more guilty and depressed. FML. I still have some hope that it will get better. Let's have hope together, ok?"", '7': ""i think not everyone has fancy dreams and big goals towards their life. I have struggled about that for a long time but recently, i realize that my goal is to have a stable and peaceful life, nothing big.\n\nI don't think you should force yourself to figure out what you want in life. Just take everything slowly. Try to enjoy your life at your own pace. Focus on your passions and interests. Then, eventually one day, you will figure out what you really want in life. You can't just figure this out by forcing yourself to keep thinking about it.\n\nAlso, you may set small goals every day, like i should tidy up my room today. Start with small things, then u can gradually set bigger goals. "", '8': ""I've been an introvert for a big part of my life (not a hardcore one too ) I had friends just like you, but socializing with people for me was just meh. Went and still going through depression during uni, and oh boy when you are an introvert and dealing with depression, you just feel like the only one living in this world and nobody else is responding no matter what you do. My introversion was also the reason I've never got to have a girlfriend, as socializing with people is just too much for me and the fact that you might end up with the wrong person or someone that will emotionally hurt you. It was just unnecessary for me. It's really hard to convince someone who went through alot to stay strong and keep fighting all these problems. But honestly no matter how little the things, you still hold on to, are. Just keep your head up, try filling your schedule because if you leave yourself to your own thoughts it's gonna consume you. I've been procrastinating alot and just being lazy because of what I went through, but I'm trying as well to change it. Just try and never give up !"", '9': 'You can push through the next few weeks. It is soooo good you have gotten an appointment that is literally the first step to take. You realize you need help and to talk to someone for that help so that is another step you have completed!!!! You are not lazy at all. I totally understand what you mean. There are days where I am literally paralyzed by my brain. It’s hard to explain the feelings I get but they’re terrible to say the least. We all have our stories and struggles and anxieties and things that stress us out. Everyone’s problems are different just like everyone’s path. Try not to compare yourself to others because you are so uniquely you. You’re still successful and smart and motivated sometimes our brains just need another way to chill. \n\nYou’re on the right path. I am sorry there is nothing I can really say to make you feel better in the moment. I don’t know you personally but you’re taking responsibility for yourself and taking care of yourself and that is the most important thing in your life right now. A lot of people will never understand, and that is okay, not everyone needs to understand. If there is someone in your life you think would maybe hear you out maybe hang with them in meantime but tread lightly I guess ? Idk the people in your life but I am sure there are people that DO care about you, even if you think they don’t. \n\nAlways try therapy before medication btw always good to see if you can do it on your own! Of course if it is super necessary then yeah but I hope you know what I mean. \n\nGood luck! Stay positive. ', '10': ""I broke down and stopped school when I had one year left for a shitty finance degree but at the top University in my state. Now I'm 24 and work minimum wage at a fucking mall cafeteria job. I regret it to this day that I was such a bitch about school and didn't just man up and put in the work to finish my last year despite knowing I was probably unemployable. I just didn't want to suffer anymore. But guess what? not having that degree after 3 years of work puts you in the same place as a high school drop out nowadays. The fact that you made is 3 years in a computer science degree says you don't belong at McDonald's. Don't stress about the gpa and just focus on doing your best and passing the classes and have your degree. It's in computer science so I wouldn't worry job prospects. Just think that you'll be putting your ENTIRE academic career at risk by quitting. From preschool all the way to highschool and the 3 years you've been in college. You've come too far man to let it all be for nothing. Even if you fail and it will take longer to finish KEEP GOING KEEP TRYING. Quitting cold turkey like I did will fucking haunt you like it's been haunting me. Just take all those shitty thoughts and ignore them and focus 100% on school. Stay strong brother"", '11': ""Hi :) I think everyone goes through these ups and downs in life and you will find that there are more people than you think out there who also feel like they don't have that group of close friends\n\nI'm not going to try and give you any answers on that right now since it seems like lots of people are already giving you advice, and it's 2 am here so I'm going to fall asleep pretty soon, but I also want to say to not put so much weight into girls/ crushes/ the fact that you don't have a girlfriend!\n\nYou're only 17. That's so young! In just a few years you will look back and think how you were such a baby. Not in a negative way, but you'll feel bad for having been so hard on yourself if you were. \n\nRelationships are nice but also they are not meant to fill you up entirely. Find your worth in yourself first and eventually the friendships and relationships will come. If you can, keep challenging yourself to meet new people and try new experiences. Lots of people, as they grow older, find it's more and more difficult to have close friends anymore just because everyone is so busy. Some day, everyone's going to be at the same place.\n\nFor now, work on your interests and work on yourself. Keep making new acquaintances - every friendship has to start from somewhere. Invest and make time for certain people if you think they are ones worth developing a deeper relationship with. But in my opinion, don't put any expectation in finding a romantic relationship just yet, because you want to have your outside support system first. It's a lot of pressure to put the expectation on just one person to come fix your loneliness and add excitement to your life. \n\nYou're so young. You're gonna change so much in just the next few years, and as long as you're challenging yourself every day, the people you see and spend time with are going to change a lot, too.\n\nDon't worry :) Everybody's lonely. Don't give up, you have a lot of time to try and figure things out."", '12': 'You are certainly not alone. And you are certainly dealing with (in my opinion, but its fact) one of the hardest, soul crushing, impossible to fully comprehend diseases you can get. Thats the reason talking to others that know can be the only relief from the extreme isolation and loneliness you feel regardless of how many people are around. It\'s an intense fight and even those who are in really deep at the moment. You are here, you are reading, you sometimes post and God dammit you are FIGHTING it. I have type 1 diabetes, got 90% of my colon removed when I was a kid so at 32 I\'m still in constant pain. Yet I would double those ailments if it meant I could have my life back with the 18 years of depression/anxiety/self-hatred wiped away. \n\nIt\'s that bad, and understandably hard to grasp if your preconceived notion of depression is having 1 bad day at the office.\n\nWe all need to have a huge discussion about the stigmatism polarized in a society that makes people in such bad shape feel ashamed and crazy because shit terms like ""mental health"" get thrown around like it\'s saying hello! I thought this was the era where progressive acceptance of taboo issues is to be fought for and understood in a more broad sense.\n\nThen why the FUCK is depression and mental health as a whole, one of the biggest underlying factors in so much shit that goes undiagnosed and creates habits or bad situations in literally all facets of life. Not only is it downplayed by media, shows, articles and soap box critics who need to insert a shitty false and triggering opinion they have no business talking about like its nothing. It\'s looked at in a negative light! No fucking WONDER more people don\'t seek treatment. \n\nI\'m going to write a huge article eventually trying to prop up this harmful group think of ignorant keyboard critics that let ego and lack of common sense destroy others without even knowing. A shift in society to support and learn about how devastating this could save so many lives I believe. Fighting this for so long now and meeting so many like us one topic always comes up. *We just want to be understood, and not looked at like some lying, lazy burden.* We all need more understanding and a voice that people respect when we try to tell them how we feel. With no interjections about their version of why we are the way we are. Just respect me trying to explain why I am the way I am, leave it at that AND THINK ABOUT IT. Give me some fucking compassion like I give you even though some weeks I can\'t get out of bed and you guilt me 100 times a moth. \n\nI love all you going through the struggle. We are all in this together, and we need to stick together and fight this. We need a voice, we need to be outraged its just accepted in this manner and IT NEEDS TO FUCKING CHANGE. Irregardless of the internet and me not knowing anyone here personally, I can gurentee you I probably could relate with you 99% better than most people I\'m close to in my life.\n\nI will keep fighting so long as everyone else does. We are worth it. We really fucking are.', '13': 'I tried to analyze your text, and commenting on some things. Check it out if you want \\^\\^\n\nIf we would sum the text up, you could say that the deciding factors which kept you in this pessimistic and downleading spiral, were:\n\n1. Fighting the depression *alone.*\n\nThis is something that I have reflected upon as well. Having this burden of feeling of not being enough to anyone, or that you do not get any acknowledgement, is just horrible. It is downright depressing being the guy that compares his life with others. Because, no matter how you compare yourself with anyone else, I have learned that you ALWAYS LOSE. For me at least, because I compare my bad sides with everyone elses\' good. \n\n2. There was a lack of hobbies / interests\n\nNow, this for me is a difficult question because I am having a hard time finding things that amuse me. Note that I am not depressed, but I have very few real interests that lets my passion burn for what it is. And, honestly I do not know how to deal with this. It\'s just hard. Really, but as long as we strive for something better, I can just hope that we find something that fulfills us one day.\n\n3. Lack of purpose\n\nI think the crucial factor here to why we lack purpose, is that our society is built upon materialistic needs. We work, to buy. To consume, and to sleep. We lack the culture of Eastern civilization, aka, spirituality. Now, if you are an athiest, then you can take this with a grain of salt since depression does not work well with religion. Been there, done that, after all. But I believe finding meaning from within you, like trying to find hobbies and people to share your life with, is what will give you purpose. Maybe not directly, but with time, it could turn out to become a ""fake it till you make it"" solution. It is the root of depression that we want to get rid of right, and you obviously already have started to work with yourself. Yet, **and you should remember this:** you might have self reflected your whole life, but if you only Q and A yourself, then a lot of good theorizing might become lost. \n\nAlso even if you are in the darkest depths of hell where darkness suffocates you, there is a small light and the light can only be found in two things: You. *Or,* someone else. Peace and love. Jaaam', '14': 'Hey, wow do I feel this post...  I\'ll be a senior in high school this fall and have no idea wtf I\'m still doing here sometimes.  Sometimes I think really similar things like how I\'ll never get into any college even though everyone around me thinks otherwise since I get good grades.  In those moments it\'s sometimes helpful to remind myself that I\'m thinking very emotionally and not necessarily rationally.  Anxiety\'s a lying bitch and depression is it\'s shitty sidekick.  \n\nI\'m sorry that your family doesn\'t really accept your depression.  It sounds like they\'re only adding lot of stress when they ideally would give the most support.  Just try and remember that your feelings are valid and real even if they come from less rational thoughts.  You may not get into your dream college (though I\'m starting to think there\'s no such thing), but you WILL get into A college (if that\'s where you want to go).  If the kid in my school who got arrested for driving drunk, high, and without his learner\'s permit past curfew can get accepted with a 2.9 GPA and ""selling weed"" as his only extracurricular, we can too.\n\nThe world is a terrifying place, but sometimes it helps to know that everyone else is pretty terrified as well, even if they don\'t seem like it.  There\'s always going to be something to stress about.  And sometimes life doesn\'t get a whole lot better, at least not quickly.  But I think that we all eventually learn how to cope better to overcome it.  \n\nLastly, I promise you that suicide sucks.  Take it from someone who\'s tried 7 times...  It\'s truly terrifying, anxiety inducing, and painful on every level.  My family was wrecked, and even after years of turmoil, I know I hurt and scared them deeply...\n\nYou won\'t be stuck in this acne-filled, panicky stage forever.  Things can and definitely will change in one way or another.  You\'ve made it this far.  What\'s just one more day?', '15': ""&gt;pretend to be happy long enough and eventually you will be.\n\nThis is so stupid. This is exactly how I have kept making my depression worse, although I was a bit more radical and denied myself pretty much having any feelings at all. It can help to try focus on the good things in life, but denying your own pain is really bad (in my non professional opinion).\n\nCan you see a professional somehow? A good therapist will listen to you and support you, not feed you silly stuff like that but rather provide tailored options how you can make steps to improving your situation. Medication might also help you. I think it's important you take these warning signs (thinking about another attempt) seriously, and take precautions. For example save a number of a suicide prevention hotline on your phone. \n\nSocial isolation sucks. Living in a bad place sucks. Debt sucks. It's not things you have to accept indefinitely. All of these things can change again. Maybe short term you have or despair is born. But long term you want to fix these things, and that might contribute to you actually feeling better about your life. There certainly will be people who want to spend their time with you, but it might not work due a multitude of reasons right now."", '16': ""I felt the exact same way once.  I still do sometimes. It sucks knowing that there is no cure for what we have and the treatment is so based in trial and error. I feel like I will have to be medicated for life. I still feel like people really don't understand depression if it is not something they deal with personally. I hate social media because it is esentially a highlight reel of all the good things happening in the lives of others. It is my personal tendency, and probably many others as well to compare ourself to others. I got rid of facebook for that reason and only have reddit. I can't stand that I am almost 30, not engaged or married, no kids, have a master's degree (that I busted my ass for) and still make less than 40k a year. I can't afford to do anything I want to do because I live alone and have no supplemental income. I am slowly beginning to realize that maybe some of those things aren't for me. I don't think I ever want kids because I would never want to knowingly bring someone into the world who would have a chance of feeling this way. But you know what? It is ok. Celebrate small successes. Find happiness in little things. My depression worsens in the winter and I love houseplants because they are alive and beautiful (when I feel dead and empty inside) and give me something to care for. Suicide is something I think of often because of my fucked up brain, but I know it is never the answer. I used to rely on alcohol and cigarettes as a form of self-medication. I have been quit smoking for 2 years (after 7 failed, but true attempts). I don't really drink anymore. Take care of your body since you only have one. I have watched someone I loved deeply suffer from lung cancer and that would be an incredibly miserable fate. You are capable of more than you know. You are worth more than you know. You are here on earth for some purpose. Science has shown that if we begin trying to think positively (even if we are faking those positive thoughts or smiles) and we do it long enough, it begins to trick our brain into actually beliving in these positive thoughts. Fake it till you make it, basically. I am still trying to work on this, and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder about 10 years ago. You can get help and it will get better, but you must want it. I wish it could go away for you, but we both know it can't. It can be managed and will get better. Stay strong. Take care of yourself. Not sure where you live, but in the US, self-wellness certainly does not seem to be valued, in my experience and opinion. Make time for it for yourself. In the meantime, know that all of those annoying happy people also have their own demons that they might not publicize."", '17': ""I miswrote that on accident actually. For a couple weeks I've fixed in my mind to do it tomorrow on Sunday at a specific time, I don't know why I wrote tomorrow last night. \n\nDo I want to live? Yes. Define living though. In my opinion living is only really living if you have the color of emotions in your life which I lost many years ago. Something which is impossible to regain. Find a hobby and enjoy it? Sure, the second half of that is where the real trouble comes though. I can't physically enjoy it, regardless of how interesting or fun it seems like it should be to me. Take in nature? I do think nature is very beautiful. I can't physically enjoy being in it though.\n\nI'm not sure if you can comprehend this concept if you haven't lost your emotions. I took them for granted. There is actually emotion attached to everything, you always feel it wherever you are and I distinctly remember it even though I only remember feeling it in elementary school. It really colors your life. But now that I've lost the ability to feel emotion? I can't feel a damn thing. Take for instance a couple weeks ago. Went on a date with this beautiful girl and we held hands and danced. But I felt nothing. And I remember what love felt like, it was extremely powerful. I felt like I should love this girl for a multitude of reasons but I just didn't *feel* it. Dancing with her should've been special, but emotionally it felt the same as doing any other mundane thing in life like taking out the trash or working. I'm so numb nothing feels different. For this reason I can't enjoy anything I used to, not hobbies, not being with friends, not anything at all. I felt more joy years ago when my life was shit than I do now. \n\nAgain I'm not sure you or anyone else can comprehend this without feeling it for yourself. Take it from me though, life is colorless without emotion and everything is the same dull grey regardless of what it is. I cannot physically enjoy anything. There is no joy to be had. Life pales in comparison to what it used to be, and guess what? It used to be a lot shittier just a few years ago, but at least I had emotions.  At least I could have fun doing things. What used to interest me like videogames or drawing which I could do for hours on end, now I can only do for ten minutes max and it's fucking hard to get myself to do it, as if it's some sort of chore.
