I did awfully in highschool and got retained two times. I still am around and trying to figure out what to do. The road is different to us all and you must measure yourself with your ruler, not others.\nCould be useful to find something to relieve some of that stress, though: exercising, sports, meditation..\nTake a MBTI test to see if you can relate with the info posted, find some career tests like holland code to start creating a future more realisticly inside your mind.\nYou can do it.

Just try to phase out the thoughts about anything that isn\'t relevant to the very moment. I\'m not trying to tell you to think happy thoughts or whatever, but just put a pause on the self-hatred. Since you stopped yourself at the last minute, it seems like you\'re not quite ready to go yet, so you might as well attempt to make your remaining stay on Earth a bit less miserable. \n\nStressed about college applications and standardized exams? You can retake the SAT and ACT if you don\'t do well this Saturday. In order to do better on your retake, you can get out the test prep book and make a daily routine that you will follow. For instance, you could complete X number of sections every week and Y amount of practice problems each day. Even if you can\'t get yourself in a chair to do more than 30 minutes, that small amount each day will accumulate over three months to 45 hours of practice, which would likely make a significant difference to your next score. \n\nYou really need to keep some of this in perspective. I\'m definitely not the best at this myself, but it seems especially important in your case. You\'re not worthless because your friends don\'t listen and you haven\'t ""accomplished anything"" in your life. Most people just aren\'t equipped to handle talking about things like depression, especially fellow hs students who are still walking around with rose colored glasses on. Moreover, you\'re just a highschool student. Basically no high school student has accomplished anything of substance, so you\'re honestly just digging for things to shit on yourself about with this one. \n\nAlso, remember that college applications aren\'t the end of the world. I was also really crushed when I was rejected from the schools that I wanted to attend, but you\'re ultimately just trying to get an education.

All of the things you said, I used to do  and still do, somedays more and others less.\nNow I’m gonna tell you one thing about what you’re struggling with. You think you don’t Exert enough of your time, energy and thoughts to do the things you wanna do. It actually may seem like.\nBut when you described about energy being drained even by the activities you love, your brain is exerting a lot of force and thoughts to want you to enjoy it. It’s like “I need to enjoy this. I can’t not” and that energy spent is why you feel drained. It’s a sub-conscious act. \nI can give you a few tips that works for . Mind you, not everyday. Some days you will not enjoy anything, feeling numb and before you start any activity, you need to tell yourself that it’s okay if I don’t enjoy the thing that I loved. It’s okay if this doesn’t lift my mood. It’s okay, Truly. You’re gonna have good and bad days.\nStart with tiny activities. Go on a short walk, you don’t even have to go out. Just go to your terrace of just stand outside your house and listen to songs you find calming. Eat an ice cream when you don’t feel good. It’s okay to feel like you’re not okay. Find little activities that generally on their own require much work. \nGet a colouring book and go crazy, or just fill in whatever color you want slowly or just doodle on your book.  \nUse music to your advantage. That’s one thing that you don’t need. To do anything. You just have to play it and even if you don’t pay attention, your brain will register it. Play nature sounds, they have apps for this and so many YouTube videos.\nOr if you don’t feel like doing anything, just lie down and rest or do nothings it’s really okay. You need to give yourself permission to feel what you feel when it’s hard. Be kind to yourself.\nI won’t say by all this everyday is gonna be a blast, but you’re gonna have good days and those good days where you start the flicker of feeling alive, it’s worth any bad day that you’ll experience, even if you can’t see that on the bad days. ', '5': 'I can’t %100 relate with this. Understand that this is oddly enough a normal thing, and many people go through this. I’d say right off the bat just talk to ur teachers. You thinking that they will think it’s an excuse is a part of depression. Ur Overthinking it. If you’re a good student and you go up to them asking for help they will understand. The fact that u went up to them will show them that u truly care. And this is actually hurting you. When it comes to grades don’t stress it too much. I know it will be very hard to just let it go but help urself first. U are more important than ur grades. stressing over the schoolwork will only give you additional stress...which u don’t need. So just relax and focus on yourself now. (try playing music on ur phone to help u get up that sometimes help me, and therapy is always a good thing. Most people don’t know but most if not all “successful” people go to therapy. All these celebrities to politicians to scholars. It just doesn’t get publicized.) keep ur head up g and never lose hope. All love 💛', '6': ""This may sound weird, but I really enjoyed your post. I know you are down but I think there is a lot of good in your life. For some people that is inspirational as it is a reminder that depression and mental disorders can affect anyone at any time. \n\n\nNot being bipolar myself, I am sure there is pain attached that I don't see. That said, I think your long term struggles may really be a strength in some ways. Many people fall into depression when they hit a wall after a long term manic episode. Not so say we are all bipolar, but everyone had ups and downs. Hopefully, and I assume owning a successful  buisness and finding love are indicators, you have the ability to detect you mood and energy. Many people fall far deeper into depression simply because they dont recognize the rut. We all can forget from time to time, that these are just low points and there will be a more elevated mood coming soon. So try not to forget that yourself. The pain you are feeling will pass. Things get better.\n\nOn the note of feeling suicidal. It sounds to me like you feel trapped. You have a successful buisness that you think you are better staying in but you are tired of maybe the consistant work load. Your husband is a wonderful guy, but some of the spark and energy is gone. So you are in duality of constantly thinking: should I stay or should I go. Thinking on this constantly can be so exhausting that it seems like the easiest choice is to end your pain. But that is not rational anymore. Obviously everyone around you will be worse off with you dead than if you chose to separate from one or both.\n\nI have two recommendations to help.\n\nFirst, if you are not seeing a therapist or counselor, I would suggest discussing your issues with one. Hopefully they can help you root out your desires and choose a path forward.\n\nSecond, I would try journaling your feelings. Personally, I think a pro and con list could be damaging, so I would just focus on what your mind is thinking, and write that down. Instead of keeping your thoughts in your head it helps you to get out ideas without judgement or anguish. Write in your phone or a computer if you dont like the idea of pen to paper. \n\nI hope this helps. \n\nAs a personal afternote, I am a 29M and married. A few months ago I had some personal drama going on and found telling my wife I loved her as I walked out the door and feeling like I was lying. I felt aweful and guilty and confused. Much like you, my partner loves me and wants a future and honestly there are few things I could find to be negative about with her. \n\nFeeling disconnected from her, I started considering all the things I disliked of her. I found basically 5 things in my life that I was not happy about. Some were directly related to her, others where just in my head. This lead to talking. Me discussing with her and admitting I was in a negative place. I never told her that I didnt think I loved her, but communicated all the other issues and a feeling of disconnect. Relationships require communicating our feelings with our partners. \n\nWe worked on some things, but ultimately i have discovered that my appriciation with her is much more about me than her or anyone else. When we like ourselves and our life and accept ourselves, we like those in our lives an appriciate them more. I won't say i am not occasionally still disconnected from her, but we have had a great couple of days lately, and she is at work now while I am at home. I can say I miss her and love her and it is an honest change from just a few months ago.\n\nFor me at least, life is fucking weird and sometimes you have to roll through the bad to get back to the good. It's like following a GPS down a shitty road. The GPS may have you on it for miles but once you realize you dont like the road and you want off, it may require a detour and some driving down the same road, but the sooner you realize, the sooner you can find an improvement. Killing yourself would just be a crash on a shitty road. That is no way to end this trip.\n\nGood luck and I hope this helps. Sorry for such a long post. \n"", '7': ""Its that time of year man. I'm also failing one of my classes and I've got no idea if the school will even let me back in January. You absolutely have to stay on top of your workload in college, its like having a full time job if you're taking enough courses. \n\nOnly thing that really helps me is taking my mind off of it, whether through playing video games , spending time with friends, and other things. Which is bad in a way because it can lead to procrastination and course failure like you know. \n\nI think success is about consistency and keeping to routines. And keeping everything in moderation. Too much study and you've got no free time social life, or if your'e totally absorbed in your free time activities then its hard to find any real life success that way. "", '8': 'Hey there, just letting you know that I think it’s awesome that you have written this and put thoughts into words - it’s definitely something that’s helped me come to terms with my situation. \n\nAs someone who has done the college thing and proceeded to burn out afterwards because my chosen career area made me miserable, I’ll say this: everyone’s path is different. I don’t think getting a degree made me feel like I was living my best years - it’s made my depression worse, all for a piece of paper. But hey, everyone’s different. \n\nIf college is really important to you, by all means go for it. But, try not to feel discouraged by self doubt and the perspectives of others. Easier said than done, I know - that’s one thing I’m still learning, that no one needs to follow a direct timeline to accomplish society’s understood ‘happiness’. If college takes you 5 years or 15 years, make sure you do things on your terms with your well being in mind, because at the end of the day that’s what matters most.\n\nFind things that make you feel even just ‘okay’ even on the worst days, and hug your girlfriend tight - she sounds like a keeper. Good luck my friend, I’ll be thinking of you :)', '9': 'Sorry that you are hurting, this sounds like a rough situation. \n\nYou are right at the age where you will have to ask yourself if you might be better off setting out on your and figuring out whatever life you can make for yourself, even if you give up a lot of money or advantage for staying involved in your family. For example, I might guess that they pay for your schooling and other things, and maybe without them you might lose that. But you can still try to find some sort of work just to survive on your own and try to have a halfway decent life. You could maybe even continue school some day by applying for financial assistance once you declare yourself as an independent adult without much income, whereas right now if you are listed as dependent on your parents who make money you probably couldn\'t get any financial aid. \n\nI do not think you should ""run away"" in the sense that you physically leave that house any time soon. But I think you should probably start planning as fast as you can. You are probably better off to be located here in the US. I don\'t know if you are a citizen, hopefully so since you say you\'ve already been here a number of years. \n\nI really only see two options. If you want your family to pay for college and give you a place to live etc, then you are pretty much forced to ""get along to get along"", meaning that you try to avoid as much conflict with them as you can, deal with your restrictive life with them, only as long as you have to in order to get whatever benefit you can from them. Use them if you have to, put up with them just long enough to get your education and have a place to live, and as soon as you\'ve made it far enough to maybe break free, then you do it. \n\nIf you cannot stand to even wait a little bit longer or live under the threat that they are going to send you back home, then you might have to consider sacrificing some of the things they provide you and instead leave soon. Find some friends who want to live together as roommates and share rent costs and get whatever basic job you can find and start out on your own. A life of washing dishes for money and sharing an apartment with a few other people might still feel better than dealing with your family. I know this is easier to say that to do, especially if your family won\'t even let you start working so you can start to hide a little bit of money. \n\nOnly you know how realistic some of what you are describing is. Maybe deep down you know your parents just like to be abusive and scare you but that they probably aren\'t really going to send you back home. You have to judge whether you think that\'s something you really need to fear or if they are just talking bullshit. \n\nSo I would either take advantage of them for a while, get what you can, get your education paid for, pretend to get along and to follow their rules, do it for a few years and then get out on your own, or if you really feel that you cannot even survive doing that, then you need to really get serious about thinking if you can find any way to go live on your own immediately. \n\nThis would be a worse situation if you were younger, if you were 16 or something and describing these problems. But you are 18 and it is perfectly legal to start thinking about breaking off from your family. You just have to decide, can you pretend to smile and get along with them long enough to finish school, or do you really need to get out right now.\n\nAs far as medication etc, again since you are 18 if you could find a way to contact your doctor again and tell them how your mother took your medication away, try to get more and make sure to keep it hidden. ', '10': ""Hi :) I think everyone goes through these ups and downs in life and you will find that there are more people than you think out there who also feel like they don't have that group of close friends\n\nI'm not going to try and give you any answers on that right now since it seems like lots of people are already giving you advice, and it's 2 am here so I'm going to fall asleep pretty soon, but I also want to say to not put so much weight into girls/ crushes/ the fact that you don't have a girlfriend!\n\nYou're only 17. That's so young! In just a few years you will look back and think how you were such a baby. Not in a negative way, but you'll feel bad for having been so hard on yourself if you were. \n\nRelationships are nice but also they are not meant to fill you up entirely. Find your worth in yourself first and eventually the friendships and relationships will come. If you can, keep challenging yourself to meet new people and try new experiences. Lots of people, as they grow older, find it's more and more difficult to have close friends anymore just because everyone is so busy. Some day, everyone's going to be at the same place.\n\nFor now, work on your interests and work on yourself. Keep making new acquaintances - every friendship has to start from somewhere. Invest and make time for certain people if you think they are ones worth developing a deeper relationship with. But in my opinion, don't put any expectation in finding a romantic relationship just yet, because you want to have your outside support system first. It's a lot of pressure to put the expectation on just one person to come fix your loneliness and add excitement to your life. \n\nYou're so young. You're gonna change so much in just the next few years, and as long as you're challenging yourself every day, the people you see and spend time with are going to change a lot, too.\n\nDon't worry :) Everybody's lonely. Don't give up, you have a lot of time to try and figure things out."", '11': ""Hello. I can relate to you, around the same age, developed some social anxiety issues and overall life around me seems dull, but a dull comfort.. a kind of comfort that makes you uneasy and unfulfilled.\n\nBut then we have to make decisions to try and improve things. And gosh, that kind of risk is just scary for people like us. We end up curling into balls into our shells of a world and then everything seems to be far away from reach. Hard. I can see you do have some ambitions albeit small at first and that's good. Look, sometimes it helps to let someone pick apart your worries and help you create a little plan. Meds can help, but not all of them will work like expected. CBT can help but sometimes a good therapist makes a huge difference, through their empathy and genuine interest in seeing you better. We have to find ways and you are still looking and far too young to call it quits. Do not give up yet.\n\nI know social anxiety is hard. The way we are exposed to stellar people is unbearable at times. Every minute we waste seems like we are becoming nothing. Life is not one size fits all. We will find courage in small steps. Try not to pressure yourself into being someone else. You are you and you should take your time and it's important to remember that everyday you do better than yesterday, it's an improvement.\n\nI considered being a social worker at a time. I'm studying for a similar area. I do work an office job but trying to change carreers. I always felt like I'd be awful at phone calls and talking to clients but my empathy ans worry in being enough made me stellar among the co-workers. Maybe that's also you.

Sure, I get down times and I feel bad most days but, I work my ass off all week, I contribute to this shitty system with taxes like ""normal"" ppl do. 4 hours of commute and 8-10 hours at work moving heavy stuff, hard work for bad pay(I couldnt stick with school), I dont whine at all in fact, I only speak about my problems when I dont really have a choice(like explaining to my boss why late or absent so often). Its hard to keep a job but I keep finding new ones. Basically, I keep doing what ""normal"" ppl do, and I am not the only one, I\'m pretty sure about that. She\'s dead wrong, never listen to that crap. If you need time off you find a way to take time off, if you feel rested enough and ready to do something you do something. Just do what you can and listen to your needs. Its not easy to deal with depression, whether its from the affected person\'s perspective or the one dealing with that said person. I also think some ppl just dont have the brain capacity to even start to understand. I hope this helps change your view about yourself  and other ppl\'s reaction to you opening up. Also, do try, and keep trying and failing if necessary,but keep trying and getting back up. Easier said than done iknow, but I\'ve done it and still doing it btw, so are others like us. Just keep trying, eventually, you\'ll get more resilient to the effects, you\'ll still fall but, you\'ll get back up and try some more.

It is actually insane how much this kind of thing affects me as well. Had a 4.0 freshman year and have dwindled out. As I have missed assignments, piled on the absences, and slowly become a slacker over the years, I continued to beat myself up about it every time. I feel like a shitty person and then take even more shitty actions because I don’t love myself enough to try anymore. But I cheer myself up knowing my potential and after all, it is only high school. NO ONE is a perfect student. No one. It is a rat race out there and we cannot just pay attention to the 2% who are perfect in their school work. We have to accept that we will make mistakes and get back up. I’m currently very motivated to give college my all, with the expectation that I am going to mess up here and there. Don’t be so hard on yourself! I know the struggle and I know that it is easier said than done. Hang in there :)', '15': 'I\'d suggest a break from worrying about finding a relationship right now when you find yourself in a streak of one bad experience after another. You don\'t have to close yourself off to it if suddenly the right person pops up, but just don\'t make it a main priority to worry about right now.\n\nThat weight loss is awesome. Over the past few years I got up above 300 which I never thought I\'d do, and getting back down to 210 sounds like paradise to me. You\'re awesome for doing that and you should just keep putting energy like that into yourself for right now. Think of the effort it took to change your life to the tune of 200lbs and ask yourself if you\'re really ready to give up on that right now. \n\nMaybe it\'s not the right time to play devil\'s advocate but frankly there is no air-tight reason that anyone can give you to stay and you probably know that. I got some strange health news a few weeks ago at 31 years old and I don\'t know why the hell I should continue when I already had enough wrong with my life, but I\'m trying to hang on for better days too.\n\nWhatever good things happened in your past, any time you met somebody new, etc, you had no idea those things were going to happen. You probably didn\'t have some special feeling 2 weeks before meeting someone that started to let you know that you were on the verge of the next good thing happening. So just apply that to now, you might feel like shit, but you have no idea how close you are to the next thing that will be enjoyable. As much as at this point you may say all those things ended up being negative anyway. That\'s why relationships these days are a really shitty place to try to find your happiness because my god is it hard to find a good loyal person who isn\'t fucked in the head. So that is not the place you want to be looking for a reliable reason to keep breathing. People are so inconsiderate these days with the way they disappear and can\'t even take 20 seconds when it\'s not even face-to-face and just send a message that says ""I had fun but I don\'t see us continuing to hang out, take care"". \n\nPlease give it one more chance for the seasons to change in your life and for this shitty time to pass by. If you can endure what it took to lose that weight you seem like a super hero to me because I get upset and give up before I can even lose 5 lbs. If you can put up with what it took to lose 200 then I think you have what it takes to hang on tight and see where things are at in a few weeks. \n\nDon\'t keep looking for the next random female who\'s supposed to  make your life great.

They make us lose touch with reality.  It becomes harder to bond with others because we can't even agree on fundamental truths.  We then find that we can't have both.\n\nThe reason I don't think it will be a problem is because I've known a few hundred sentences about you &amp; I already see that you're far too self aware.

Keeping weed just to have fun  - assuming it didn't have that other crap - also makes sense to me.  I'm not anti weed.

Im in my forties and have multiple degrees but because of depression I am currently working stocking shelves. I'm not sure I'm mentally capable of doing more than that right now. But the what I've come to accept and maybe this will help is that where you are right now is temporary. Where people are in life right now is temporary for everybody.  You are not a failure until you give up. Secondly - your parents love you not matter what. They are not disappointed in you.  They love you and want the best for you. Don't forget that. Finally- don't beat yourself up. My advice is to set short and long term goals. The short term goals can be as simple as committing to going for a walk each morning or praying each morning if you believe in that. Maybe goto the library every once in a while to get out the house and look for jobs on their computers. You prolly have a computer or a phone at home it's more to just get out of the house. Long terms goals can be set but they won't happen overnight. These things need to be done I stages. If your suffering from anxiety and depression as I do seek help.  There are resources out there for you. Just try to do a little each day. If you have a bad day and lay in bed all day like I've done forget about and makes commitment to try a little harder the next day. Little by little things will get better. But it's a process and can be a frustrating one at that. I suggest talking to someone you trust about what your feeling and going through. I can be someone online.   The bottom line is your are not a failure until you give up.  Give yourself a break and don't beat yourself up. You'd be surprise at how many people feel the same way you do.   Take care my friend. If you want PM if you wanna talk. I am very much in the same situation as you described."", '2': 'Honestly, the best thing you can do is just take life day by day. Just try to phase out the thoughts about anything that isn\'t relevant to the very moment. I\'m not trying to tell you to think happy thoughts or whatever, but just put a pause on the self-hatred. Since you stopped yourself at the last minute, it seems like you\'re not quite ready to go yet, so you might as well attempt to make your remaining stay on Earth a bit less miserable. \n\nStressed about college applications and standardized exams? You can retake the SAT and ACT if you don\'t do well this Saturday. In order to do better on your retake, you can get out the test prep book and make a daily routine that you will follow. For instance, you could complete X number of sections every week and Y amount of practice problems each day. Even if you can\'t get yourself in a chair to do more than 30 minutes, that small amount each day will accumulate over three months to 45 hours of practice, which would likely make a significant difference to your next score. \n\nYou really need to keep some of this in perspective. I\'m definitely not the best at this myself, but it seems especially important in your case. You\'re not worthless because your friends don\'t listen and you haven\'t ""accomplished anything"" in your life. Most people just aren\'t equipped to handle talking about things like depression, especially fellow hs students who are still walking around with rose colored glasses on. Moreover, you\'re just a highschool student. Basically no high school student has accomplished anything of substance, so you\'re honestly just digging for things to shit on yourself about with this one. \n\nAlso, remember that college applications aren\'t the end of the world. I was also really crushed when I was rejected from the schools that I wanted to attend, but you\'re ultimately just trying to get an education. It ultimately doesn\'t matter whether that path starts at a 4 year flagship university or a community college; the end goal is just to graduate with the sheet of paper. \n\nYou shouldn\'t feel guilty for being a ""leech"" on your parents. They signed up for the financial burdens of raising a child after all. In reality, you\'re likely projecting your own feelings about yourself onto your parents. It\'s unlikely that they\'re actually disappointed in you or expect you to fix yourself on your own. Your parents wouldn\'t expect you to fix a broken bone, so why would they expect you to fix a broken mind? \n\n', '3': 'I once read: ""You are not good enough to get frustrated, you are bad enough to keep trying.""  \n\n\nMy friend, you are 20. Your life is a blank piece of paper waiting to be writen. You probably feel like garbage now, but this existential crisis is very good for you. You are questioning yourself and this is something that all of us will eventualy do or have allready done. Asking yourself towards your direction at your twenties will make the path easier for you because you will have figured yourself a little bit more which, I think, is paramount in order to live a wholesome life.   \n\n\nYeah, there are other guys at your age that make a lot more of money. Good for them. This does not mean that you cannot make a decent amount of money in five years, or in ten.   \n\n\nYour life is beginning, you have just reached the age in which people start doing things for their own, and not for anybody else.   \n\n\nFind what makes you happy. Take time to find that out and then, go for it. It\'s easier said than done, but it\'s the only way of getting things done. It get\'s easier.  Everyday, it gets a little easier.  But you gotta do it everyday, that\'s the hard part. But it does get easier. ', '4': 'Sorry that you are hurting, this sounds like a rough situation. \n\nYou are right at the age where you will have to ask yourself if you might be better off setting out on your and figuring out whatever life you can make for yourself, even if you give up a lot of money or advantage for staying involved in your family. For example, I might guess that they pay for your schooling and other things, and maybe without them you might lose that. But you can still try to find some sort of work just to survive on your own and try to have a halfway decent life. You could maybe even continue school some day by applying for financial assistance once you declare yourself as an independent adult without much income, whereas right now if you are listed as dependent on your parents who make money you probably couldn\'t get any financial aid. \n\nI do not think you should ""run away"" in the sense that you physically leave that house any time soon. But I think you should probably start planning as fast as you can. You are probably better off to be located here in the US. I don\'t know if you are a citizen, hopefully so since you say you\'ve already been here a number of years. \n\nI really only see two options. If you want your family to pay for college and give you a place to live etc, then you are pretty much forced to ""get along to get along"", meaning that you try to avoid as much conflict with them as you can, deal with your restrictive life with them, only as long as you have to in order to get whatever benefit you can from them. Use them if you have to, put up with them just long enough to get your education and have a place to live, and as soon as you\'ve made it far enough to maybe break free, then you do it. \n\nIf you cannot stand to even wait a little bit longer or live under the threat that they are going to send you back home, then you might have to consider sacrificing some of the things they provide you and instead leave soon. Find some friends who want to live together as roommates and share rent costs and get whatever basic job you can find and start out on your own. A life of washing dishes for money and sharing an apartment with a few other people might still feel better than dealing with your family. I know this is easier to say that to do, especially if your family won\'t even let you start working so you can start to hide a little bit of money. \n\nOnly you know how realistic some of what you are describing is. Maybe deep down you know your parents just like to be abusive and scare you but that they probably aren\'t really going to send you back home. You have to judge whether you think that\'s something you really need to fear or if they are just talking bullshit. \n\nSo I would either take advantage of them for a while, get what you can, get your education paid for, pretend to get along and to follow their rules, do it for a few years and then get out on your own, or if you really feel that you cannot even survive doing that, then you need to really get serious about thinking if you can find any way to go live on your own immediately. \n\nThis would be a worse situation if you were younger, if you were 16 or something and describing these problems. But you are 18 and it is perfectly legal to start thinking about breaking off from your family. You just have to decide, can you pretend to smile and get along with them long enough to finish school, or do you really need to get out right now.\n\nAs far as medication etc, again since you are 18 if you could find a way to contact your doctor again and tell them how your mother took your medication away, try to get more and make sure to keep it hidden. ', '5': ""Have you ever heard of MeetUp? Give it a try if not. \n\nIf you have the time, get a dog. It will help you learn to love yourself, as well as give you routine, structure, and a foundation of unconditional love. Don't get just any dog though. Try to find one that will fit your lifestyle. ( ie, if you live in a tiny apartment, don't get a big dog that requires space)\n\nMost importantly..... STOP BEING SO HARD ON YOURSELF! You are judging your performance, in timeline based on others. Don't do this. \nDon't focus on 'im this age and others by this age have done (x) and I havent'. You are setting yourself up for failure as soon as you judge yourself. \n\nYou have to go at your own pace brother. \n\nHis Holiness the Dalai lama said, 'the best relationship is one in which the love for each other exceeds the need for each other'.\n\nYour confidence isn't that great? Dude, I'd die to have been stable enough to stay at a job for more than 2 years. I'm 26, and probably had more jobs than 4 people combined! \n\nYou have it in you man. You really do.

That's so young! In just a few years you will look back and think how you were such a baby. Not in a negative way, but you'll feel bad for having been so hard on yourself if you were. \n\nRelationships are nice but also they are not meant to fill you up entirely. Find your worth in yourself first and eventually the friendships and relationships will come. If you can, keep challenging yourself to meet new people and try new experiences. Lots of people, as they grow older, find it's more and more difficult to have close friends anymore just because everyone is so busy. Some day, everyone's going to be at the same place.\n\nFor now, work on your interests and work on yourself. Keep making new acquaintances - every friendship has to start from somewhere. Invest and make time for certain people if you think they are ones worth developing a deeper relationship with. But in my opinion, don't put any expectation in finding a romantic relationship just yet, because you want to have your outside support system first. It's a lot of pressure to put the expectation on just one person to come fix your loneliness and add excitement to your life. \n\nYou're so young. You're gonna change so much in just the next few years, and as long as you're challenging yourself every day, the people you see and spend time with are going to change a lot, too.\n\nDon't worry :) Everybody's lonely. Don't give up, you have a lot of time to try and figure things out."", '7': ""Hi OP. You are doing better, you said it yourself, don't forget this because it is the more important detail. We have bad days, this is unavoidable, but I would like to suggest a correction. I disagree that you have entered sudden relapse. I think you have had a sudden *lapse*. The difference is important you see, because we focus on the negatives. You've had a good few weeks, you're getting it done dude. Think of it like this, you have gone forward one step, another, another, another x20, oops back one step. You are still many steps ahead, this lapse does not undo *you*.  \n\nDoes it help to realise that there is a direct cause behind this fleeting lapse? You stayed up late to do work (which you deserve kudos for, good on you for working hard dude), and didn't sleep well, and this gave you a bad start on today. But here's what you will do, you will go right back to the healthy routine you have been building for yourself. You'll go to sleep at a good time, maybe slightly earlier as you're tired (I like to take a cup of chamomile tea, don't know if it's a placebo but I like the taste now anyway). Tomorrow you will wake up, this is my promise to you.  \n\nSometimes you just need a day to yourself, I hope you did something nice for yourself, something relaxing. I go to this group on Wednesdays by a charity that supports people with eating disorders, and I spoke to a woman doing a Law conversion course (3 years packed into 1 year, yikes). And she said she was having a bad day, and she didn't go to her lectures. She was doing an adult colouring book and I was doing something else, and we talked and I told her that it is ok, because sometimes you just need a day. Self-care is the most important thing after all, you can catch up on missed lectures, the course will still be there tomorrow. You don't deserve to feel bad for doing what you needed to do, because sometimes we just have to, and it can be hard to raise our heads above the parapet for long enough to realise this for ourselves, so I wanted to make sure that I could at least say it to you. Keep on keeping on OP, best of luck with the course and everything :)  \n\nEdit: Sentence structure."", '8': ""It seems like you really want to reject the idea of being an adult, but being an adult does not mean that you can't have free time for yourself, it doesn't mean that you have to quit things that you enjoy such as playing video games. I want to ask you this, who are you useless for? Society? Does it matter?  If you don't buy games, how will the people making games get any money? It is their job to make you take some time off. It is your job to survive in this society, not to please it. Working a full-time job is your way to survive, and trying to finish your education is a investment in order to perhaps get a better standard of life in the future. You don't owe yourself, or the society anything. Yes, life is meaningless in the bigger perspective - objectively, however being alive is a subjective thing, meaning of life is also a subjective thing. \n\nSpeaking of experience, no matter what you do, something is wrong. I know how you feel, because i felt exactly the same way, except that i refused to do anything before i get my shit figured out. I had so much spare time, that it was not even funny. I would get guilty for doing nothing, but that was what i wished for! Now I'm currently studying, I still get guilty for doing things other than working on school work. I spend about four hours every day in my spare time on school work, i go to a local charity organization and offer some of my spare time to charity. I am still not satisfied. \n\nMy best advice is this, take a shit in the void, because shit will fill it up. You say life is meaningless, yet at the same time you give meaning to the drive trying to make you do shit. You do not need to respect your feelings, feelings are just a guide trying to shape you into who you are. You are the god of your universe, and feelings are in a sense are your best friend giving you advice on how to tackle current events, you do not have to listen.

Every other person looks like some masterful painting. But to be honest, I'll bet you're just as they are, normal looking, pretty even. It's just your own self perception that makes you feel ugly. I've come to grasps that I am a normal looking person although I still struggle with it. But yeah, try not to worry what other people think, honestly they probably aren't even thinking anything about your looks, just going on with their day. It's easier said than done, I know.

Sometimes there will be many days at a time that aren’t great, but my friend that is just part of the life we have been blessed with (even though it doesn’t feel like a blessing all the time). \nMy advice is to know that you are only here for a short time in the great scheme of things and you should wake up every day and know it’s a new day and it can be as great as want to be within your control. It’s ok to be upset over things, but take a second and ask yourself : can I control this? Is it worth it? Will I even remember being upset over this? If the answer to any of these questions are no then try to push forward past it. Life is going to be hard, but it is definitely worth it. The bad and the good. Try to be positive and everyday remember the things you’re grateful for. \nMy depression can get the best of me some days, but every day I wake up and pray (obviously not for everyone and I’m not pushing it on you at all) for all my loved ones/anyone else I think needs help in the morning and it helps to put my mind in the right place.

But hey, everyone’s different. \n\nIf college is really important to you, by all means go for it. But, try not to feel discouraged by self doubt and the perspectives of others. Easier said than done, I know - that’s one thing I’m still learning, that no one needs to follow a direct timeline to accomplish society’s understood ‘happiness’. If college takes you 5 years or 15 years, make sure you do things on your terms with your well being in mind, because at the end of the day that’s what matters most.\n\nFind things that make you feel even just ‘okay’ even on the worst days, and hug your girlfriend tight - she sounds like a keeper.

You think you don’t Exert enough of your time, energy and thoughts to do the things you wanna do. It actually may seem like.\nBut when you described about energy being drained even by the activities you love, your brain is exerting a lot of force and thoughts to want you to enjoy it. It’s like “I need to enjoy this. I can’t not” and that energy spent is why you feel drained. It’s a sub-conscious act. \nI can give you a few tips that works for . Mind you, not everyday. Some days you will not enjoy anything, feeling numb and before you start any activity, you need to tell yourself that it’s okay if I don’t enjoy the thing that I loved. It’s okay if this doesn’t lift my mood. It’s okay, Truly. You’re gonna have good and bad days.\nStart with tiny activities. Go on a short walk, you don’t even have to go out. Just go to your terrace of just stand outside your house and listen to songs you find calming. Eat an ice cream when you don’t feel good. It’s okay to feel like you’re not okay. Find little activities that generally on their own require much work. \nGet a colouring book and go crazy, or just fill in whatever color you want slowly or just doodle on your book.  \nUse music to your advantage. That’s one thing that you don’t need. To do anything. You just have to play it and even if you don’t pay attention, your brain will register it. Play nature sounds, they have apps for this and so many YouTube videos.\nOr if you don’t feel like doing anything, just lie down and rest or do nothings it’s really okay. You need to give yourself permission to feel what you feel when it’s hard. Be kind to yourself.\nI won’t say by all this everyday is gonna be a blast, but you’re gonna have good days and those good days where you start the flicker of feeling alive, it’s worth any bad day that you’ll experience, even if you can’t see that on the bad days.

I can see you do have some ambitions albeit small at first and that's good. Look, sometimes it helps to let someone pick apart your worries and help you create a little plan. Meds can help, but not all of them will work like expected. CBT can help but sometimes a good therapist makes a huge difference, through their empathy and genuine interest in seeing you better. We have to find ways and you are still looking and far too young to call it quits. Do not give up yet.\n\nI know social anxiety is hard. The way we are exposed to stellar people is unbearable at times. Every minute we waste seems like we are becoming nothing. Life is not one size fits all. We will find courage in small steps. Try not to pressure yourself into being someone else. You are you and you should take your time and it's important to remember that everyday you do better than yesterday, it's an improvement.\n\nI considered being a social worker at a time. I'm studying for a similar area. I do work an office job but trying to change carreers. I always felt like I'd be awful at phone calls and talking to clients but my empathy ans worry in being enough made me stellar among the co-workers. Maybe that's also you. You can do it, but if you want to talk further, I'd be more than happy to be of assistance. I'm rooting for you."", '14': 'I\'d suggest a break from worrying about finding a relationship right now when you find yourself in a streak of one bad experience after another. You don\'t have to close yourself off to it if suddenly the right person pops up, but just don\'t make it a main priority to worry about right now.\n\nThat weight loss is awesome. Over the past few years I got up above 300 which I never thought I\'d do, and getting back down to 210 sounds like paradise to me. You\'re awesome for doing that and you should just keep putting energy like that into yourself for right now. Think of the effort it took to change your life to the tune of 200lbs and ask yourself if you\'re really ready to give up on that right now. \n\nMaybe it\'s not the right time to play devil\'s advocate but frankly there is no air-tight reason that anyone can give you to stay and you probably know that. I got some strange health news a few weeks ago at 31 years old and I don\'t know why the hell I should continue when I already had enough wrong with my life, but I\'m trying to hang on for better days too.\n\nWhatever good things happened in your past, any time you met somebody new, etc, you had no idea those things were going to happen. You probably didn\'t have some special feeling 2 weeks before meeting someone that started to let you know that you were on the verge of the next good thing happening. So just apply that to now, you might feel like shit, but you have no idea how close you are to the next thing that will be enjoyable. As much as at this point you may say all those things ended up being negative anyway. That\'s why relationships these days are a really shitty place to try to find your happiness because my god is it hard to find a good loyal person who isn\'t fucked in the head. So that is not the place you want to be looking for a reliable reason to keep breathing. People are so inconsiderate these days with the way they disappear and can\'t even take 20 seconds when it\'s not even face-to-face and just send a message that says ""I had fun but I don\'t see us continuing to hang out, take care"". \n\nPlease give it one more chance for the seasons to change in your life and for this shitty time to pass by. If you can endure what it took to lose that weight you seem like a super hero to me because I get upset and give up before I can even lose 5 lbs. If you can put up with what it took to lose 200 then I think you have what it takes to hang on tight and see where things are at in a few weeks. \n\nDon\'t keep looking for the next random female who\'s supposed to  make your life great. If you admit that you have a mom and a sister and friends who worry about you, put some energy into them. If you\'re like me you\'d probably reach for the moon and stars to do something special if you had a new romantic interest but the day-to-day people in your life can kind of get taken for granted. Put some time and energy and love into the people you already have, the people who aren\'t going to disappear on you when you text them and ask them something. ', '15': ""Honestly it's weird.\n\nBeing in my mid 30s compared to my life how it used to be in my 20s is a completely different person and life. It sucks knowing(or thinking) that things will never ever be the same. I really wish the advice I had learned in the past few years I was able to tell my younger self. \n\nThe older you get with depression the worse off your brain and body gets. It gets kinda sad too since I always had that young age look and over the past few years I've aged really quick. Depression seems to take the toll on your body as if you were a drug addict. The very few people I have talked to swore that I was on drugs 24/7. Which gets me down even more cause its like well thanks for telling me I look like shit. \n\nIf any of you young people are reading this, do what you can to build your confidence. The best things you can really do is help out your body, workout, eat right, and read. It may not fix your problems but keeping your body in top shape both mentally and physically does help. \n\nI'm hoping some day stem cell research can come in and save the day. "", '16': 'Well that person is wrong and she doesnt know what she is talking  about. Sure, I get down times and I feel bad most days but, I work my ass off all week, I contribute to this shitty system with taxes like ""normal"" ppl do. 4 hours of commute and 8-10 hours at work moving heavy stuff, hard work for bad pay(I couldnt stick with school), I dont whine at all in fact, I only speak about my problems when I dont really have a choice(like explaining to my boss why late or absent so often). Its hard to keep a job but I keep finding new ones. Basically, I keep doing what ""normal"" ppl do, and I am not the only one, I\'m pretty sure about that. She\'s dead wrong, never listen to that crap. If you need time off you find a way to take time off, if you feel rested enough and ready to do something you do something. Just do what you can and listen to your needs. Its not easy to deal with depression, whether its from the affected person\'s perspective or the one dealing with that said person. I also think some ppl just dont have the brain capacity to even start to understand. I hope this helps change your view about yourself  and other ppl\'s reaction to you opening up. Also, do try, and keep trying and failing if necessary,but keep trying and getting back up. Easier said than done iknow, but I\'ve done it and still doing it btw, so are others like us. Just keep trying, eventually, you\'ll get more resilient to the effects, you\'ll still fall but, you\'ll get back up and try some more. Just keep at it because your life, however dark or pointless it may seem at this moment, just might get better. You wont know if you dont try. Cheers.', '17': ""In time it will. Just know that you will never be who you used to be. And then that's okay because who used to be was only the Forefront for who you are meant to become. And every few years you'll go through a new challenge that won't either make or try to break you it's meant to make you into who you're supposed to be but if you can't see it that way you're going to let it break you and go right back into depression again. The only way to fight that it's to always be vigilant and to be thankful for what you already have and to not let anger or hatred or pain or any of that other stuff into your heart because the minute you start to allow those things to affect you what accompanies it is doubt and fear I want to companies that is depression. If you're willing enough to open your mind you'll be willing enough to change it to have to work hard to apply it because fear and doubt and our brains are hardwired to want to be negative so you have to be willing to constantly work at rewiring it to more positive way of thinking. And doing this you have to be careful of how you think and how you speak not only to others and about situations that happened in your life but also got how you speak about yourself. Every time you complain every time you feel angry because someone cut you off or someone was rude those little things add up and as they add up you're allowing yourself and training yourself to let every little thing bother you. If you can train yourself to let the little things go and focus on the positive you find that you're able to have more energy for the things you want in your life. With all that said I hope you have a better day today practice some positive thinking look into that cognitive behavioral therapy and remind yourself that there is hope and that you can get this done just take it one day at a time and be ready for the setbacks but look forward to the comebacks""}",<b> I got some great relevant comments with highlighted words for you: </b>,click event:1

Im in my forties and have multiple degrees but because of depression I am currently working stocking shelves. I'm not sure I'm mentally capable of doing more than that right now. But the what I've come to accept and maybe this will help is that where you are right now is temporary. Where people are in life right now is temporary for everybody.  You are not a failure until you give up. Secondly - your parents love you not matter what. They are not disappointed in you.  They love you and want the best for you. Don't forget that. Finally- don't beat yourself up. My advice is to set short and long term goals. The short term goals can be as simple as committing to going for a walk each morning or praying each morning if you believe in that. Maybe goto the library every once in a while to get out the house and look for jobs on their computers. You prolly have a computer or a phone at home it's more to just get out of the house. Long terms goals can be set but they won't happen overnight. These things need to be done I stages. If your suffering from anxiety and depression as I do seek help.  There are resources out there for you. Just try to do a little each day. If you have a bad day and lay in bed all day like I've done forget about and makes commitment to try a little harder the next day. Little by little things will get better. But it's a process and can be a frustrating one at that. I suggest talking to someone you trust about what your feeling and going through. I can be someone online.   The bottom line is your are not a failure until you give up.  Give yourself a break and don't beat yourself up. You'd be surprise at how many people feel the same way you do.   Take care my friend. If you want PM if you wanna talk. I am very much in the same situation as you described."", '2': 'Honestly, the best thing you can do is just take life day by day. Just try to phase out the thoughts about anything that isn\'t relevant to the very moment. I\'m not trying to tell you to think happy thoughts or whatever, but just put a pause on the self-hatred. Since you stopped yourself at the last minute, it seems like you\'re not quite ready to go yet, so you might as well attempt to make your remaining stay on Earth a bit less miserable. \n\nStressed about college applications and standardized exams? You can retake the SAT and ACT if you don\'t do well this Saturday. In order to do better on your retake, you can get out the test prep book and make a daily routine that you will follow. For instance, you could complete X number of sections every week and Y amount of practice problems each day. Even if you can\'t get yourself in a chair to do more than 30 minutes, that small amount each day will accumulate over three months to 45 hours of practice, which would likely make a significant difference to your next score. \n\nYou really need to keep some of this in perspective. I\'m definitely not the best at this myself, but it seems especially important in your case. You\'re not worthless because your friends don\'t listen and you haven\'t ""accomplished anything"" in your life. Most people just aren\'t equipped to handle talking about things like depression, especially fellow hs students who are still walking around with rose colored glasses on. Moreover, you\'re just a highschool student. Basically no high school student has accomplished anything of substance, so you\'re honestly just digging for things to shit on yourself about with this one. \n\nAlso, remember that college applications aren\'t the end of the world. I was also really crushed when I was rejected from the schools that I wanted to attend, but you\'re ultimately just trying to get an education. It ultimately doesn\'t matter whether that path starts at a 4 year flagship university or a community college; the end goal is just to graduate with the sheet of paper. \n\nYou shouldn\'t feel guilty for being a ""leech"" on your parents. They signed up for the financial burdens of raising a child after all. In reality, you\'re likely projecting your own feelings about yourself onto your parents. It\'s unlikely that they\'re actually disappointed in you or expect you to fix yourself on your own. Your parents wouldn\'t expect you to fix a broken bone, so why would they expect you to fix a broken mind? \n\n', '3': 'I once read: ""You are not good enough to get frustrated, you are bad enough to keep trying.""  \n\n\nMy friend, you are 20. Your life is a blank piece of paper waiting to be writen. You probably feel like garbage now, but this existential crisis is very good for you. You are questioning yourself and this is something that all of us will eventualy do or have allready done. Asking yourself towards your direction at your twenties will make the path easier for you because you will have figured yourself a little bit more which, I think, is paramount in order to live a wholesome life.   \n\n\nYeah, there are other guys at your age that make a lot more of money. Good for them. This does not mean that you cannot make a decent amount of money in five years, or in ten.   \n\n\nYour life is beginning, you have just reached the age in which people start doing things for their own, and not for anybody else.   \n\n\nFind what makes you happy. Take time to find that out and then, go for it. It\'s easier said than done, but it\'s the only way of getting things done. It get\'s easier.  Everyday, it gets a little easier.  But you gotta do it everyday, that\'s the hard part. But it does get easier. ', '4': 'Sorry that you are hurting, this sounds like a rough situation. \n\nYou are right at the age where you will have to ask yourself if you might be better off setting out on your and figuring out whatever life you can make for yourself, even if you give up a lot of money or advantage for staying involved in your family. For example, I might guess that they pay for your schooling and other things, and maybe without them you might lose that. But you can still try to find some sort of work just to survive on your own and try to have a halfway decent life. You could maybe even continue school some day by applying for financial assistance once you declare yourself as an independent adult without much income, whereas right now if you are listed as dependent on your parents who make money you probably couldn\'t get any financial aid. \n\nI do not think you should ""run away"" in the sense that you physically leave that house any time soon. But I think you should probably start planning as fast as you can. You are probably better off to be located here in the US. I don\'t know if you are a citizen, hopefully so since you say you\'ve already been here a number of years. \n\nI really only see two options. If you want your family to pay for college and give you a place to live etc, then you are pretty much forced to ""get along to get along"", meaning that you try to avoid as much conflict with them as you can, deal with your restrictive life with them, only as long as you have to in order to get whatever benefit you can from them. Use them if you have to, put up with them just long enough to get your education and have a place to live, and as soon as you\'ve made it far enough to maybe break free, then you do it. \n\nIf you cannot stand to even wait a little bit longer or live under the threat that they are going to send you back home, then you might have to consider sacrificing some of the things they provide you and instead leave soon. Find some friends who want to live together as roommates and share rent costs and get whatever basic job you can find and start out on your own. A life of washing dishes for money and sharing an apartment with a few other people might still feel better than dealing with your family. I know this is easier to say that to do, especially if your family won\'t even let you start working so you can start to hide a little bit of money. \n\nOnly you know how realistic some of what you are describing is. Maybe deep down you know your parents just like to be abusive and scare you but that they probably aren\'t really going to send you back home. You have to judge whether you think that\'s something you really need to fear or if they are just talking bullshit. \n\nSo I would either take advantage of them for a while, get what you can, get your education paid for, pretend to get along and to follow their rules, do it for a few years and then get out on your own, or if you really feel that you cannot even survive doing that, then you need to really get serious about thinking if you can find any way to go live on your own immediately. \n\nThis would be a worse situation if you were younger, if you were 16 or something and describing these problems. But you are 18 and it is perfectly legal to start thinking about breaking off from your family. You just have to decide, can you pretend to smile and get along with them long enough to finish school, or do you really need to get out right now.\n\nAs far as medication etc, again since you are 18 if you could find a way to contact your doctor again and tell them how your mother took your medication away, try to get more and make sure to keep it hidden. ', '5': ""Have you ever heard of MeetUp? Give it a try if not. \n\nIf you have the time, get a dog. It will help you learn to love yourself, as well as give you routine, structure, and a foundation of unconditional love. Don't get just any dog though. Try to find one that will fit your lifestyle. ( ie, if you live in a tiny apartment, don't get a big dog that requires space)\n\nMost importantly..... STOP BEING SO HARD ON YOURSELF! You are judging your performance, in timeline based on others. Don't do this. \nDon't focus on 'im this age and others by this age have done (x) and I havent'. You are setting yourself up for failure as soon as you judge yourself. \n\nYou have to go at your own pace brother. \n\nHis Holiness the Dalai lama said, 'the best relationship is one in which the love for each other exceeds the need for each other'.\n\nYour confidence isn't that great? Dude, I'd die to have been stable enough to stay at a job for more than 2 years. I'm 26, and probably had more jobs than 4 people combined! \n\nYou have it in you man. You really do.

That's so young! In just a few years you will look back and think how you were such a baby. Not in a negative way, but you'll feel bad for having been so hard on yourself if you were. \n\nRelationships are nice but also they are not meant to fill you up entirely. Find your worth in yourself first and eventually the friendships and relationships will come. If you can, keep challenging yourself to meet new people and try new experiences. Lots of people, as they grow older, find it's more and more difficult to have close friends anymore just because everyone is so busy. Some day, everyone's going to be at the same place.\n\nFor now, work on your interests and work on yourself. Keep making new acquaintances - every friendship has to start from somewhere. Invest and make time for certain people if you think they are ones worth developing a deeper relationship with. But in my opinion, don't put any expectation in finding a romantic relationship just yet, because you want to have your outside support system first. It's a lot of pressure to put the expectation on just one person to come fix your loneliness and add excitement to your life. \n\nYou're so young. You're gonna change so much in just the next few years, and as long as you're challenging yourself every day, the people you see and spend time with are going to change a lot, too.\n\nDon't worry :) Everybody's lonely. Don't give up, you have a lot of time to try and figure things out."", '7': ""Hi OP. You are doing better, you said it yourself, don't forget this because it is the more important detail. We have bad days, this is unavoidable, but I would like to suggest a correction. I disagree that you have entered sudden relapse. I think you have had a sudden *lapse*. The difference is important you see, because we focus on the negatives. You've had a good few weeks, you're getting it done dude. Think of it like this, you have gone forward one step, another, another, another x20, oops back one step. You are still many steps ahead, this lapse does not undo *you*.  \n\nDoes it help to realise that there is a direct cause behind this fleeting lapse? You stayed up late to do work (which you deserve kudos for, good on you for working hard dude), and didn't sleep well, and this gave you a bad start on today. But here's what you will do, you will go right back to the healthy routine you have been building for yourself. You'll go to sleep at a good time, maybe slightly earlier as you're tired (I like to take a cup of chamomile tea, don't know if it's a placebo but I like the taste now anyway). Tomorrow you will wake up, this is my promise to you.  \n\nSometimes you just need a day to yourself, I hope you did something nice for yourself, something relaxing. I go to this group on Wednesdays by a charity that supports people with eating disorders, and I spoke to a woman doing a Law conversion course (3 years packed into 1 year, yikes). And she said she was having a bad day, and she didn't go to her lectures. She was doing an adult colouring book and I was doing something else, and we talked and I told her that it is ok, because sometimes you just need a day. Self-care is the most important thing after all, you can catch up on missed lectures, the course will still be there tomorrow. You don't deserve to feel bad for doing what you needed to do, because sometimes we just have to, and it can be hard to raise our heads above the parapet for long enough to realise this for ourselves, so I wanted to make sure that I could at least say it to you. Keep on keeping on OP, best of luck with the course and everything :)  \n\nEdit: Sentence structure."", '8': ""It seems like you really want to reject the idea of being an adult, but being an adult does not mean that you can't have free time for yourself, it doesn't mean that you have to quit things that you enjoy such as playing video games. I want to ask you this, who are you useless for? Society? Does it matter?  If you don't buy games, how will the people making games get any money? It is their job to make you take some time off. It is your job to survive in this society, not to please it. Working a full-time job is your way to survive, and trying to finish your education is a investment in order to perhaps get a better standard of life in the future. You don't owe yourself, or the society anything.

I know how you feel, because i felt exactly the same way, except that i refused to do anything before i get my shit figured out. I had so much spare time, that it was not even funny. I would get guilty for doing nothing, but that was what i wished for! Now I'm currently studying, I still get guilty for doing things other than working on school work. I spend about four hours every day in my spare time on school work, i go to a local charity organization and offer some of my spare time to charity. I am still not satisfied. \n\nMy best advice is this, take a shit in the void, because shit will fill it up. You say life is meaningless, yet at the same time you give meaning to the drive trying to make you do shit. You do not need to respect your feelings, feelings are just a guide trying to shape you into who you are.

I've come to grasps that I am a normal looking person although I still struggle with it. But yeah, try not to worry what other people think, honestly they probably aren't even thinking anything about your looks, just going on with their day. It's easier said than done, I know.

Sometimes there will be many days at a time that aren’t great, but my friend that is just part of the life we have been blessed with (even though it doesn’t feel like a blessing all the time). \nMy advice is to know that you are only here for a short time in the great scheme of things and you should wake up every day and know it’s a new day and it can be as great as want to be within your control. It’s ok to be upset over things, but take a second and ask yourself : can I control this? Is it worth it? Will I even remember being upset over this? If the answer to any of these questions are no then try to push forward past it. Life is going to be hard, but it is definitely worth it. The bad and the good. Try to be positive and everyday remember the things you’re grateful for. \nMy depression can get the best of me some days, but every day I wake up and pray (obviously not for everyone and I’m not pushing it on you at all) for all my loved ones/anyone else I think needs help in the morning and it helps to put my mind in the right place. It helps me remember who I love so much and starts the day on a positive note as someone who is very sympathetic/empathetic. Hope this helps in anyway possible. Feel free to ask me anything else (: ', '11': 'Hey there, just letting you know that I think it’s awesome that you have written this and put thoughts into words - it’s definitely something that’s helped me come to terms with my situation. \n\nAs someone who has done the college thing and proceeded to burn out afterwards because my chosen career area made me miserable, I’ll say this: everyone’s path is different. I don’t think getting a degree made me feel like I was living my best years - it’s made my depression worse, all for a piece of paper. But hey, everyone’s different. \n\nIf college is really important to you, by all means go for it. But, try not to feel discouraged by self doubt and the perspectives of others. Easier said than done, I know - that’s one thing I’m still learning, that no one needs to follow a direct timeline to accomplish society’s understood ‘happiness’. If college takes you 5 years or 15 years, make sure you do things on your terms with your well being in mind, because at the end of the day that’s what matters most.\n\nFind things that make you feel even just ‘okay’ even on the worst days, and hug your girlfriend tight - she sounds like a keeper. Good luck my friend, I’ll be thinking of you :)', '12': 'When I read this post, I couldn’t believe the words. You were legit describing me too. All of the things you said, I used to do  and still do, somedays more and others less.\nNow I’m gonna tell you one thing about what you’re struggling with. You think you don’t Exert enough of your time, energy and thoughts to do the things you wanna do. It actually may seem like.\nBut when you described about energy being drained even by the activities you love, your brain is exerting a lot of force and thoughts to want you to enjoy it. It’s like “I need to enjoy this. I can’t not” and that energy spent is why you feel drained. It’s a sub-conscious act. \nI can give you a few tips that works for . Mind you, not everyday. Some days you will not enjoy anything, feeling numb and before you start any activity, you need to tell yourself that it’s okay if I don’t enjoy the thing that I loved. It’s okay if this doesn’t lift my mood. It’s okay, Truly. You’re gonna have good and bad days.\nStart with tiny activities. Go on a short walk, you don’t even have to go out. Just go to your terrace of just stand outside your house and listen to songs you find calming. Eat an ice cream when you don’t feel good. It’s okay to feel like you’re not okay. Find little activities that generally on their own require much work. \nGet a colouring book and go crazy, or just fill in whatever color you want slowly or just doodle on your book.  \nUse music to your advantage. That’s one thing that you don’t need. To do anything. You just have to play it and even if you don’t pay attention, your brain will register it. Play nature sounds, they have apps for this and so many YouTube videos.\nOr if you don’t feel like doing anything, just lie down and rest or do nothings it’s really okay. You need to give yourself permission to feel what you feel when it’s hard. Be kind to yourself.\nI won’t say by all this everyday is gonna be a blast, but you’re gonna have good days and those good days where you start the flicker of feeling alive, it’s worth any bad day that you’ll experience, even if you can’t see that on the bad days. ', '13': ""Hello. I can relate to you, around the same age, developed some social anxiety issues and overall life around me seems dull, but a dull comfort.. a kind of comfort that makes you uneasy and unfulfilled.\n\nBut then we have to make decisions to try and improve things. And gosh, that kind of risk is just scary for people like us. We end up curling into balls into our shells of a world and then everything seems to be far away from reach. Hard. I can see you do have some ambitions albeit small at first and that's good. Look, sometimes it helps to let someone pick apart your worries and help you create a little plan. Meds can help, but not all of them will work like expected. CBT can help but sometimes a good therapist makes a huge difference, through their empathy and genuine interest in seeing you better. We have to find ways and you are still looking and far too young to call it quits. Do not give up yet.\n\nI know social anxiety is hard. The way we are exposed to stellar people is unbearable at times. Every minute we waste seems like we are becoming nothing. Life is not one size fits all. We will find courage in small steps. Try not to pressure yourself into being someone else. You are you and you should take your time and it's important to remember that everyday you do better than yesterday, it's an improvement.\n\nI considered being a social worker at a time. I'm studying for a similar area. I do work an office job but trying to change carreers. I always felt like I'd be awful at phone calls and talking to clients but my empathy ans worry in being enough made me stellar among the co-workers. Maybe that's also you. You can do it, but if you want to talk further, I'd be more than happy to be of assistance. I'm rooting for you."", '14': 'I\'d suggest a break from worrying about finding a relationship right now when you find yourself in a streak of one bad experience after another. You don\'t have to close yourself off to it if suddenly the right person pops up, but just don\'t make it a main priority to worry about right now.\n\nThat weight loss is awesome. Over the past few years I got up above 300 which I never thought I\'d do, and getting back down to 210 sounds like paradise to me. You\'re awesome for doing that and you should just keep putting energy like that into yourself for right now. Think of the effort it took to change your life to the tune of 200lbs and ask yourself if you\'re really ready to give up on that right now. \n\nMaybe it\'s not the right time to play devil\'s advocate but frankly there is no air-tight reason that anyone can give you to stay and you probably know that. I got some strange health news a few weeks ago at 31 years old and I don\'t know why the hell I should continue when I already had enough wrong with my life, but I\'m trying to hang on for better days too.\n\nWhatever good things happened in your past, any time you met somebody new, etc, you had no idea those things were going to happen. You probably didn\'t have some special feeling 2 weeks before meeting someone that started to let you know that you were on the verge of the next good thing happening. So just apply that to now, you might feel like shit, but you have no idea how close you are to the next thing that will be enjoyable. As much as at this point you may say all those things ended up being negative anyway. That\'s why relationships these days are a really shitty place to try to find your happiness because my god is it hard to find a good loyal person who isn\'t fucked in the head. So that is not the place you want to be looking for a reliable reason to keep breathing. People are so inconsiderate these days with the way they disappear and can\'t even take 20 seconds when it\'s not even face-to-face and just send a message that says ""I had fun but I don\'t see us continuing to hang out, take care"". \n\nPlease give it one more chance for the seasons to change in your life and for this shitty time to pass by. If you can endure what it took to lose that weight you seem like a super hero to me because I get upset and give up before I can even lose 5 lbs. If you can put up with what it took to lose 200 then I think you have what it takes to hang on tight and see where things are at in a few weeks. \n\nDon\'t keep looking for the next random female who\'s supposed to  make your life great. If you admit that you have a mom and a sister and friends who worry about you, put some energy into them. If you\'re like me you\'d probably reach for the moon and stars to do something special if you had a new romantic interest but the day-to-day people in your life can kind of get taken for granted. Put some time and energy and love into the people you already have, the people who aren\'t going to disappear on you when you text them and ask them something. ', '15': ""Honestly it's weird.\n\nBeing in my mid 30s compared to my life how it used to be in my 20s is a completely different person and life. It sucks knowing(or thinking) that things will never ever be the same. I really wish the advice I had learned in the past few years I was able to tell my younger self. \n\nThe older you get with depression the worse off your brain and body gets. It gets kinda sad too since I always had that young age look and over the past few years I've aged really quick. Depression seems to take the toll on your body as if you were a drug addict. The very few people I have talked to swore that I was on drugs 24/7. Which gets me down even more cause its like well thanks for telling me I look like shit. \n\nIf any of you young people are reading this, do what you can to build your confidence. The best things you can really do is help out your body, workout, eat right, and read. It may not fix your problems but keeping your body in top shape both mentally and physically does help. \n\nI'm hoping some day stem cell research can come in and save the day. "", '16': 'Well that person is wrong and she doesnt know what she is talking  about. Sure, I get down times and I feel bad most days but, I work my ass off all week, I contribute to this shitty system with taxes like ""normal"" ppl do. 4 hours of commute and 8-10 hours at work moving heavy stuff, hard work for bad pay(I couldnt stick with school), I dont whine at all in fact, I only speak about my problems when I dont really have a choice(like explaining to my boss why late or absent so often). Its hard to keep a job but I keep finding new ones. Basically, I keep doing what ""normal"" ppl do, and I am not the only one, I\'m pretty sure about that. She\'s dead wrong, never listen to that crap. If you need time off you find a way to take time off, if you feel rested enough and ready to do something you do something. Just do what you can and listen to your needs. Its not easy to deal with depression, whether its from the affected person\'s perspective or the one dealing with that said person. I also think some ppl just dont have the brain capacity to even start to understand. I hope this helps change your view about yourself  and other ppl\'s reaction to you opening up. Also, do try, and keep trying and failing if necessary,but keep trying and getting back up. Easier said than done iknow, but I\'ve done it and still doing it btw, so are others like us. Just keep trying, eventually, you\'ll get more resilient to the effects, you\'ll still fall but, you\'ll get back up and try some more. Just keep at it because your life, however dark or pointless it may seem at this moment, just might get better. You wont know if you dont try. Cheers.', '17': ""In time it will. Just know that you will never be who you used to be. And then that's okay because who used to be was only the Forefront for who you are meant to become. And every few years you'll go through a new challenge that won't either make or try to break you it's meant to make you into who you're supposed to be but if you can't see it that way you're going to let it break you and go right back into depression again. The only way to fight that it's to always be vigilant and to be thankful for what you already have and to not let anger or hatred or pain or any of that other stuff into your heart because the minute you start to allow those things to affect you what accompanies it is doubt and fear I want to companies that is depression. If you're willing enough to open your mind you'll be willing enough to change it to have to work hard to apply it because fear and doubt and our brains are hardwired to want to be negative so you have to be willing to constantly work at rewiring it to more positive way of thinking. And doing this you have to be careful of how you think and how you speak not only to others and about situations that happened in your life but also got how you speak about yourself. Every time you complain every time you feel angry because someone cut you off or someone was rude those little things add up and as they add up you're allowing yourself and training yourself to let every little thing bother you. If you can train yourself to let the little things go and focus on the positive you find that you're able to have more energy for the things you want in your life. With all that said I hope you have a better day today practice some positive thinking look into that cognitive behavioral therapy and remind yourself that there is hope and that you can get this done just take it one day at a time and be ready for the setbacks but look forward to the comebacks""}",<b> I got some great relevant comments with highlighted words for you: </b>,click event:1
