I am drowning in negativity
I feel a deep sense of fatigue and hatred inside of me. It's sick and dark, but extremely magnetic, addictive, powerful, and it hasn't left me. It's not clear whether this is because of my father, who I am told had felt a similar level of hatred towards his father. It's a cycle of repressed hate that grows and consumes, weak people asserting strength and extending the sense of defeat. I have a chronic disease of personality, it is eating at me, and no amount of belching is getting it out of me.",3,3,"{'function': 0.6020408163265306, 'article': 0.05102040816326531, 'bio': 0.07142857142857142, 'health': 0.061224489795918366, 'auxverb': 0.11224489795918367, 'verb': 0.1836734693877551, 'focuspresent': 0.12244897959183673, 'quant': 0.01020408163265306, 'conj': 0.09183673469387756, 'prep': 0.14285714285714285, 'relativ': 0.10204081632653061, 'space': 0.08163265306122448, 'cogproc': 0.11224489795918367, 'cause': 0.01020408163265306, 'differ': 0.04081632653061224, 'time': 0.02040816326530612, 'adj': 0.05102040816326531, 'certain': 0.02040816326530612, 'percept': 0.061224489795918366, 'see': 0.02040816326530612, 'affect': 0.09183673469387756, 'negemo': 0.08163265306122448, 'drives': 0.05102040816326531, 'achieve': 0.02040816326530612, 'power': 0.04081632653061224, 'death': 0.01020408163265306, 'ingest': 0.01020408163265306, 'adverb': 0.01020408163265306, 'social': 0.061224489795918366, 'family': 0.02040816326530612, 'male': 0.030612244897959183, 'sad': 0.01020408163265306, 'insight': 0.04081632653061224, 'feel': 0.02040816326530612, 'focuspast': 0.04081632653061224, 'reward': 0.01020408163265306, 'negate': 0.04081632653061224, 'anger': 0.030612244897959183, 'pronoun': 0.19387755102040816, 'ppron': 0.10204081632653061, 'shehe': 0.01020408163265306, 'i': 0.09183673469387756, 'ipron': 0.09183673469387756, 'anx': 0.01020408163265306, 'compare': 0.01020408163265306, 'posemo': 0.01020408163265306, 'interrog': 0.02040816326530612}","{'mode': 'RE', 'feedback': '<b> You may want to take a look at these highly rated comments: </b>', '0': ""I have been doing this for years, and I can tell you assuredly I do it because I hate myself, intensely. It is a false hate, born from insidious machinations of depression, and it took me a very long time to realize this, about 10 years. \n\nThis was 2, maybe 3 years ago, and I was on the verge of breaking up with my boyfriend over text because of emotional issues going on at the time, to no one's surprise. We were going to spend a week together at the beach with my parents, but I told him to stay home and leave me be. He instead drove 3 hours to meet me and confronted me about why I was trying to end things in the first place, leading to a long discussion of my issues for the umpteenth time, and we both realized at that point that my irrational hatred for myself and desire to destroy was not of myself but of something more sinister, seeking to increase my own suffering using my body as a vessel.\n\nI describe it in such a way because imagining my depression as something separate, almost physical like a demon to be banished, helps me tune out the unending hatred I bear towards myself. The hatred is irrational, so instead of fighting fire with fire, I seek to live a life that gives me physical proof that I'm not a piece of shit, that I'm loved, and that I've lived well. The evidence I use to rationalize that I can't be as bad a person as I think, and therefore what I think is wrong. It's helped me shift perspectives from someone absolutely hating themselves all the time to someone who can at least take small pride in some things, who is at least somewhat okay with himself, and hopefully who will one day learn to like or even love himself. "", '1': ""On a personal level because I have no social status, no romantic prospects, no talents, no work ethic, no job, no friends, no life, and because im ignored, belittled, criticised, ostricised, shamed, laughed at and lied to more than anything else. Because I have no future in front of me and because of all the pain in the past behind me. \n\nOn a global level because human nature seems to be predominantly selfish and we seem to seek to dominate each other. I see a cycle of the strong subjugating the weak whether it's on the playground or in the office or on in a global geopolitical theatre. For which there is no resolution and which is just a characteristic of human behaviour. I even see it in myself and don't know whether to fight against my nature or to allow it. \n\nThen on a spiritual level questions regarding the nature of fear, pain, and life. Just exactly what are fear and pain and why do they carry this essence of evil within them? What is this universal undercurrent that I seem to detect running through the pitch black darkness of the night, and in the pain of my body breaking , and in the fear of everything that i seek to avoid, and in the insanity of a schizophrenic. Is it an illusion that's created by me putting all of these undesirables into the same category or does the evil itself exist beyond my own mind? Is it something that exists only within us or is it something inherent in the universe itself? In death am I destined to an eternity of oblivion or am I just a manifestation of the singular essence of life itself and will I emerge elsewhere in another form and body for another lifetime . And if all life is a universal manifestation of the same thing then am I as a type of life not intertwined with the very universe itself?   And if all of the universe is one then is all of the filth an extention of myself? Why am i compelled to ask the questions if i can never possibly know the answers? \n\n\n\n\n"", '2': ""I feel ya. \n\nThis is something which has plagued me since childhood. These days, I've developed a coping method (a defense mechanism) whose purpose is to ensure the fulfillment of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Rather than remain in a state of uncertainty whether or not someone will appreciate my company, I will go out of my way to purposely alienate them. Whenever I do this I have a great feeling of satisfaction. It is so seamlessly intertwined with my personality it blends in perfectly with my own introversion. Truth be told, I've never felt like I've had any meaningful relationships face to face. Currently I've maintained zero friendships with anybody outside of the internet and alienation is virtually the only thing I know how to do well. I'm consciously aware my attitude is inhibiting the development of any sincere connections (extending towards my own development as a person) from arising and yet I'm content, morbidly satisfied, with being vilified.   \n\nWelcome 2 da club."", '3': 'You are certainly not alone. And you are certainly dealing with (in my opinion, but its fact) one of the hardest, soul crushing, impossible to fully comprehend diseases you can get. Thats the reason talking to others that know can be the only relief from the extreme isolation and loneliness you feel regardless of how many people are around. It\'s an intense fight and even those who are in really deep at the moment. You are here, you are reading, you sometimes post and God dammit you are FIGHTING it. I have type 1 diabetes, got 90% of my colon removed when I was a kid so at 32 I\'m still in constant pain. Yet I would double those ailments if it meant I could have my life back with the 18 years of depression/anxiety/self-hatred wiped away. \n\nIt\'s that bad, and understandably hard to grasp if your preconceived notion of depression is having 1 bad day at the office.\n\nWe all need to have a huge discussion about the stigmatism polarized in a society that makes people in such bad shape feel ashamed and crazy because shit terms like ""mental health"" get thrown around like it\'s saying hello! I thought this was the era where progressive acceptance of taboo issues is to be fought for and understood in a more broad sense.\n\nThen why the FUCK is depression and mental health as a whole, one of the biggest underlying factors in so much shit that goes undiagnosed and creates habits or bad situations in literally all facets of life. Not only is it downplayed by media, shows, articles and soap box critics who need to insert a shitty false and triggering opinion they have no business talking about like its nothing. It\'s looked at in a negative light! No fucking WONDER more people don\'t seek treatment. \n\nI\'m going to write a huge article eventually trying to prop up this harmful group think of ignorant keyboard critics that let ego and lack of common sense destroy others without even knowing. A shift in society to support and learn about how devastating this could save so many lives I believe. Fighting this for so long now and meeting so many like us one topic always comes up. *We just want to be understood, and not looked at like some lying, lazy burden.* We all need more understanding and a voice that people respect when we try to tell them how we feel. With no interjections about their version of why we are the way we are. Just respect me trying to explain why I am the way I am, leave it at that AND THINK ABOUT IT. Give me some fucking compassion like I give you even though some weeks I can\'t get out of bed and you guilt me 100 times a moth. \n\nI love all you going through the struggle. We are all in this together, and we need to stick together and fight this. We need a voice, we need to be outraged its just accepted in this manner and IT NEEDS TO FUCKING CHANGE. Irregardless of the internet and me not knowing anyone here personally, I can gurentee you I probably could relate with you 99% better than most people I\'m close to in my life.\n\nI will keep fighting so long as everyone else does. We are worth it. We really fucking are.', '4': 'Hmm interesting post. Where are you in your life at the moment? In terms of age, job, financial position, weight? \n\nI\'m 28 and going through a major existential crises of complete confusion and despair. Most of my day is spent trying to bat of any feeling of deep insecurity. But strangely that has translated into only enjoying conversation with strangers. Although, they rarely happen as I developed anxiety. But when they do, I actually do enjoy them, after the initial feeling of ""fuck someone who is talking to me"". I don\'t have any friends, never been great at managing relationships anyway but over the last 2 years, I\'m just ashamed of who I am so it\'s much better to speak to strangers who don\'t know you, then those who have this image of who you used to be.  I used to love going out, meeting people being social. Now not so much. I find myself not amused by anything really. In the same way you do. For me it\'s again because I\'ve stacked up at 0 in my career, financially and in personal development. I\'m sure if those areas were recharged and replenished I would start enjoying life a bit more but at the moment it\'s all pretty much the same. Sub par mood, with continuous feelings of hate for who I\'ve become. Pretty awesome right. \n\nStupid question but how open are you creatively? Do you, maybe not now, but in the past, try new things? Whether it be hobbies or parts of life you never even thought about? I am super open and always have been. So for me, I\'ve tried this and unfortunately doesn\'t work consistently but I pick up a book or watch a doc or go to an exhibition about something I know nothing about. Like I said unfortunetly it hasn\'t worked for me in any sifnicant and meaningful way but sometimes I do get absorbed by a new topic area. I literally paid zero attention to politics and sociology, but recently find myself reading and watching a lot of content on things like ""left vs right"" or ""class structures"" or reasons for inequality. ', '5': 'I am actually glad that you posted this, because I feel the same way and I have never been able to express this to anyone or make anyone understand. When my depression got to it\'s worst point, this was what I thought about constantly- I couldn\'t be without something to occupy my mind because this is where my thoughts would drift and I would get terrified and feel like my head was spinning and feel nauseous. There were a million other problems I had/have due to my depression but this is probably the worst. It made it harder that everyone I have met, or communicated with who has depression doesn\'t fear death and doesn\'t obsess over the fear of death but rather wants to die/commit suicide etc. \nI will always say that I am a huge supporter of medication for depression for those who need it. It took me a couple of tries on meds, it\'s not the most fun process, but when I finally landed on the one that worked for me (wellbutrin), I noticed within weeks that the obsession over these thoughts diminished significantly. I was able to focus on my life because I wasn\'t constantly haunted with the thoughts. This was amazing to me because having the thoughts only contributes to the cycle of being depressed. \nI still have the moments, in the shower or laying in bed before falling asleep where I think about how everyone who is old always says ""life goes so fast,"" and it does go faster the more time goes on. I\'m terrified of aging because I know that it brings me closer to death. I dread the thought that one day I will be old and just awaiting my death, and I can\'t go back, can\'t change a thing, can\'t buy more time. \nPeople always say that you matter to others, and you\'ve made impacts in others lives, or that they needed you. That\'s true, and I am thankful that I have been there for those who needed me. It\'s hard to explain, but I still don\'t find that helpful at all because I think about how that only matters because we exist in the first place. If none of us existed it wouldn\'t matter at all. If those people hadn\'t been born it wouldn\'t matter at all. We exist solely to keep the race existing which feels meaningless to me. I often feel anger because we are living in a cruel world and I often resent the fact that I/humans were given a brain so capable of emotion, such deep thought, feeling so deeply, such a longing for meaning yet in the end we are never granted that (besides through religion, which doesn\'t work for me). \nThe thought of ceasing to exist in itself also terrifies me, the thought of not being, of not seeing what happens to the world, of simply turning to dust and hundreds of years later never being remembered. Even if souls remain and spirits exist, I fear watching years from a distance unable to speak with or touch my loved ones. Years and years in the future, the earth will be gone along with me and everything we ever did as humans here will no longer matter. \nI also wish many times that I was never born so I never had to feel these things. I refuse to have children for these reasons. I refuse to pass the depression and these feelings on to another human being, I wouldn\'t wish it upon anyone. That to me would be one of the most cruel things I could do. But I also refuse to have children because I feel that you spend your life getting attached to people who will eventually die. If nothing else takes you first, you have some good years. Then your grandparents or relatives die, your parents die, then your siblings may die before you. Whoever doesn\'t die before you is left with the sadness of losing you. So many people are obsessed with focusing their whole life on their career, years and years of education (Sometimes this makes people happy, education can make you happy, and that is awesome- I don\'t mean to put this down in all circumstances but many who go to college hate it- myself included). They waste their lives away, stressed out about work and money, only to make it to being old and now all your good years are gone. \nWhat I have gained that is positive from these thoughts is realizing that I should do what makes me happy because the time I have is short. When I am laying in my death bed I don\'t want to be thinking about what I should\'ve done, or shouldn\'t have, or how I should\'ve focused on the people I loved. Fuck what everyone else tells me I need to do to be happy- I don\'t need to have kids, I don\'t need to have a wildly successful career. If you\'re genuinely happy working at a grocery store and it pays your bills honestly who the fuck cares if everyone else is saying ""oh, that\'s not a career, that\'s not right, you should be somewhere else."" Never listen to anyone who says ""When I was your age I had x or y by now!"" It\'s a whole different playing field for this generation. I seek jobs and work that make me happy, or, at least, don\'t make me miserable. I refuse to stay in a job where I am miserable. I worked hard to get my credit to a good score so that I could take a vacation to Hawaii at 23 years old, and pay it off over a few months. Do whatever you can to do the things that make you happy while you are young. Traveling or whatever else makes you happy will be more difficult when you are old (When it\'s hard to walk, when you have tons of medications or who knows what else; a need for insulin, an oxygen tank). \nHopefully sharing how I feel didn\'t make you more depressed, I suppose the points I wanted to make are that there is no shame in medication or counseling. Don\'t let people who have never had depression try to tell you anything about it, how to fix it, or that it\'s invalid. Don\'t let them try and tell you things about medication, because at the end of the day, sure there are terrible problems with the pharmaceutical industry but antidepressants save lives in more ways than one. I highly recommend studying the psychology of depression/ how dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine etc. work. It helps you gain a great understanding that you are sick (just like someone with any other disease) and your brain doesn\'t work like other peoples instead of feeling ridiculous and invalid. And lastly, use every moment you have wisely, really do the things that make you happy. Don\'t let yourself be walked all over. Figure out how to realistically achieve your goals/happiness, because simply hearing ""life is great, you can do anything if you put your mind to it, this guy went from nothing to a millionaire so you can too!"" Doesn\'t help you feel motivated when you have depression at all. \nI wish you the best, you aren\'t alone!', '6': 'Fuck man you already know me on a personnal level.\nI mean I don\'t want to be cocky so let us not attribute that to intelligence, just a point lof view amongst others.\n\nThen again, about my small window frame, I try to enjoy that.\nLike I said, I go out, I do enjoyable things. But when it is over, I just feel like "" shit I still would rather die"".\nI already had some \'it is good to feel really alive moments\' , but they give me only small hope. I\'d like to be driven by such moments, to crave the little pleasures of life, the good moments.\n\nBut for some reason my mind sees life as an ocean of sadness and boredom with sprinkles of happinness inside. Heck, I know I won\'t be able to keep it up like this. I\'d like my parents to at least believe I am happy and well before they pass away. But it\'s like I can\'t. I can\'t cope with life.\n\nHow the hell did you do ? Did you like start doing a lot of productive things ? Kind of things that give you a hard time but end up really satisfying ?\n\nIf I was actually able to see what is going to happen next, wouldn\'t I be alarmed by the shit I am diving neck deep inside of ? Wouldn\'t I force myself to get my shit together ?\n\nBecause the only answers to that question I have is that I am a will-less husk of a weak person.\nI see people able to take 2 degrees at the same time, people able to work on a project 8 hours a day. How do you get motivated ? \nHow do you want to live life fully , with all the good and the bad ? How can people enjoy this shit ? Especially when 90% of all we do and go through is based upon a ton of lies ? There is no truth or meaning anymore , how can I forget this and just build my little cocoon of willingness and mitivation ?', '7': ""Therapy isn't about telling you how to fix your life. Usually CBT is about listening to you, showing a flaw or two of your thinking or how you come up with it and then letting you ahhhhhhhhh yourself. \n\nFor me, I had an abusive father and a substance addict mother with mental problems who left. For me, I was riddled with many different coping mechanisms and thought patterns that completely screwed me and my self esteem. By talking about certain things, my therapist was able to show me intellectually how just because they were my parents, they had flaws. Flaws that as an adult I can see, but the child in my brain thought of them as gods. That there was a reason my dad told me I'll never amount to much, and if I talked back he'd beat me with an inch of my life or I ruined all his hopes and dreams because I was born. Or a mother who didn't find me worthy enough to get help and left because it was easier. Showed me Maslow's hierarchy and was able to show me that this feeling of emptiness and pain I overcompensated with hard headedness and shifting my pain onto others and walls I have put up to protect myself. I think back on different parts of my life and if I would have been able to genuinely listen to him. I think because I felt genuinely broken, I faced my fears and wanted to hear what they had to say. I wanted to change. I wanted to break my walls. I don't know if it helps, I think stories can personally bring me a lot of realizations because it's like one of those Ad lib books, and I can see my story inside someone else's. I hope you feel better soon. \n\nEdit: clarity"", '8': 'Don’t ever be embarrassed to admit you have depression! I’ve suffered with ADD, Depression, and anxiety since I was little. My parents noticed and took me in to see a psychiatrist when I was 13 years old but I would lie to avoid being put on medicine. In the end it back fired because at 20 years old I had a mental break down. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. I would say the same thing how can I feel like this when I am truly blessed and have an amazing life. Now I am on medicine and finally found the right one after three years of being a lab rat. What I am getting to is it’s okay to be depressed, one we live in a crazy world but two depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain. Medicine will help level everything out and it’s good to start now so you can learn how to train your brain so eventually you won’t need medicine. If your parents don’t believe you tell them to go online and look up chronic depression. I always say the mind is more powerful than we think, and mental illness is a CHRONIC disease. Robert Williams for example, we all thought he was happy when he suffered from the terrible thoughts of depression. So take a deep breath, write all your feelings down and then read it to your parents. The best way for them to understand the thoughts going through your head is by telling them sometimes you feel life would be better without you. Don’t be afraid to cry, let it all out people who don’t suffer from mental illness won’t ever  understand but it’s real and they’re are facts to prove it. Everything will be okay and once you tell your parents it will feel like ten pounds lifted off your shoulders. If you ever feel hopeless and think life is better without you remember even though you’re sad you have a BIG heart which is very rare now in society.❤️❤️', '9': ""I've been considered good looking all my life, in my part of the world. To the point that I can see that people want something extraordinary from me, a miracle or something of that sort. I question every friendship I had. Was it because of my looks or there is some personality involved. Btw, this is a str8 dude talking. I got chicken pox last month and I feel much better now. My inner voice always identified with ugliness and I am actually ugly now. Just to tell you that I am struggling with the burden of attractiveness.\n\nYou know what, I would have told you the same thing, you look anorexic, as well, without spending a single calorie. No one, I mean exactly 0 number of people care about you. At least for me it it true. \n\nBe the best mother/father you can be, and do your best in your career, whatever it is or it is not.  Fuck these people. I don't think it is about how you look. I think it is about how you feel. Take your blanket off and show your daughter what bravery is. Show them your bones, and tell them that you have a place in this world just because you are kind to them. "", '10': ""Yeah, I came here to say chemically, no. I find it weird I never got addicted the self harm I did. Even a few finger nail sized scars though remind me of how low I was in terms of coping skills, I really am trying to moderate a bit what I say here because I have a lot of shame over it and hatred towards the act because of it, but self harm may make sense as a last resort coping skill, it also lowers the chances of learning better coping skills.\n\nI'm concerned, OP, that it's the only thing that makes you feel alive, because the rest of your life doesn't seem the best then. Better coping skills would speak to doing what you can in that regard. (Really, just what you can, this is a admonition over your life not being perfect. Heck, I really only branch out to get to good situations myself and have done little to fix or directly address the bad in my own life.)"", '11': "" &gt; but does anyone feel the same way I do?\n\n\nYes &amp; No.  No one feels the exact combination of feelings which you're feeling with that intensitiy for those reasons at this time.  In some sense your feelings are unique.  \n\nBut if you boil down those feelings to what they stem from, then yes, many people feel what you feel.  \n\nTo begin with many people find some degree of comfort in depression.  Depression has comforting traits.  It allows you to be in a safe space where you don't do new &amp; challenging things where you might be judged or rejected.  Depression is a reason that people stay in bed or in a comfortable (but wrong) relationship.  Yes, this is common.\n\n.  \n\nSecondly, most of what you described on motivation leads me to believe that anger gives you strenth when you can't find hope.  This is pretty substantial. It isn't the best case scenario but it also isn't the worst.  Also you mention that the things which it gives you strength to do are work out &amp; develop a personality. These particular goals are telling about your priorities.  Specifically whether you feel good enough.\n\n.\n\nTo wrap it up, yes *many* people have felt the way that you feel.  It does have benefits but the drawbacks to such powerful coping mechanisms are substantial.  Like any other coping mechanism, it is corrosive.  The longer you co-exist with it, the more damaging it is to the rest of your life.  Right now it's what you need to feel/do but you will get to a point that you'll ask yourself what it's all for.  Why work out and have an excellent personality if you don't trust women &amp; refuse to have a meaningful relationship?  Why promote suffering to become a stronger person if you have nothing in your life to fight for? Eventually all of this has to be *for something*.  That something *- whatever it is for you -* comes at the other side of treating the problems which are prompting these extreme coping mechanisms"", '12': 'That sounds like me, pretty close. I\'ve been diagnosed with depression and struggling with it for decades. So you could have depression, with those symptoms. Others here at r/depression have commented about having or reaching a level of depression that\'s below sad, where a person stops feeling much. It\'s more likely a person has depression if a person also has other symptoms of depression too, such as loss of interests and disrupted sleep patterns.\n\nSo I\'m reading your comment again, because I can\'t say for sure. Point by point, where are we similar or different?\n\nApologizing for posting or commenting, sometimes before getting to the point? Similar.\n\nClaiming to feel okay in general? Similar. If I think about how my body feels, it\'s usually okay, and that doesn\'t seem to have anything to do with emotions, it seems about my state of health and whether I\'m physically tired. It\'s a low chance at any minute that I\'m in the middle of feeling sad, which I would notice because I would be crying or feeling the symptoms of crying such as sore eyes or a lump in the throat. I might be in that state 0 minutes a day in some weeks, and averaging 30 minutes a day in other weeks when I\'m thinking about past problems in my life more. It\'s a lower chance I\'d be smiling or laughing in any minute. I usually wouldn\'t say that I ""feel happy"" as a way of describing it, if am in the middle of smiling or laughing that I may get for a few seconds in a day.\n\nThinking one has problems feeling anything or problems feeling anything strongly? Similar. I didn\'t realize this was a problem, because I just didn\'t know what other people meant by ""feeling."" I thought that my thoughts about situations and how those thoughts seemed to me, such as what tone of voice I would imagine expressing them in, was my emotions, and I thought everyone else was like that. Since I found out it\'s so different for other people, two months ago, I\'ve been trying to figure out what the difference is or what\'s going on with me. I think maybe the feelings that I would feel somewhere in my body, somehow, if I were more normal, are subliminal to me, so that I just know in my mind what my emotional reaction is to a thought in the minute or my mood is over an hour, but I don\'t literally ""feel"" it, unless there\'s a strong reaction such as crying. A reaction could be an expression of anger where if it\'s strong I\'ll get some tension in my gut and warmth in my face. Warmth in my face could be from embarrassment, or just anything. So I don\'t use the literal feeling as a way to tell what my emotion is. It wouldn\'t make sense that way. That would be totally unreliable. The literal feelings are just sensations of expressing something, which tells me that the emotion I already knew I was having in my mind is a strong emotion. Anger that\'s literally felt that much, that I\'m sure about, is maybe once a month.\n\nCrying about things read or seen? Not so similar. I\'ll cry if I think about how something I think or read or see relates to what\'s wrong in my life, or the life of someone I know. I\'d think it would be weird to cry about something in news or entertainment, without a personal connection or a personal thought about it. For instance, when I saw Titanic in a theater, I cried when all the people were falling off the ship into the water, because I thought life is like that: things are going along, then people die. When the movie tries to get people to cry with the little story about a romantic fling and which of those two characters dies or survives, that didn\'t matter as much to me.\n\nNot much behind crying or laughing? Similar for laughing, not similar for crying. When I\'m laughing, what\'s behind it is I noticed something funny, and that\'s unimportant. When I\'m crying, there are thoughts that are really important to me involved, that I can be concerned about as problems even if not crying.\n\nAfter laughing feeling the same as before? Similar, but what else would you expect? Seriously, is there supposed to be some effect? Is there supposed to be an effect on literal feelings, from laughing?\n\nCan stop crying at any moment? A little similar, but sometimes it\'s worse so it would take a minute to completely stop the expression of crying.\n\nNever getting angry or disappointed when something bad happens? Halfway similar. I\'ve noticed when I get angry is when there\'s something I\'m trying to do something very important and I have to deal with a computerized phone system that keeps making mistakes because it wants me to say something by voice, and I have to yell at it to be clear, and it still gets it wrong again and again, instead of just letting me press buttons. It\'s like they make those phone systems for important services with the intention of torturing people emotionally and messing with their lives. I never get angry that much at people in person. Disappointment is real, but it\'s in my mind. If you meant an emotion, I don\'t know, maybe if it leads to crying more because life is so awful.\n\nNot being able to care about people? No, I care enough to worry, and give people things when they need something. I cry about memories after someone I knew dies.\n\nNot feeling bad about never getting something wanted? Similar, halfway. Since wanting something is just a thought, and there are so many different things that a person could get or do in life, there\'s usually not any bad feeling about it, and I think that\'s the way it\'s supposed to be. However, if I think about how I\'ve missed out on doing certain things that other people almost all do, over so many years, and there seems to be something unfair about it, or some thought that it might never happen for me, then I may cry about it.\n\nNot knowing if one really enjoys activities or not? Similar.\n\nNot getting a ""good job"" feeling from one\'s brain? Similar. What does that even mean though? Do people get feelings from things they do, other than from the results? For instance, if a person cooks something, there can be a feeling from the result: tasting it and it tastes good. There\'s your feeling. Making music, you hear the music and it sounds like music. There\'s your feeling. Drawing, you finish a picture, and it looks like an interesting picture. There\'s your feeling. Why would you even expect anything else?\n\nNot knowing if all this is normal or wrong? Similar.\n\nI\'m sorry about how long this response is. It\'s like usual for me, what else am I going to do? I\'m not sure what I want. This subject of emotions seems important to me, so I write things that long for myself. Why not share it? It seems fair since you posted at a place that takes comments, so maybe you want a comment.', '13': '&gt;I know dreams are irrational and dont make sense (at least 95% of mine dont),\n\nThat\'s because we ""remember"" only small amount of it, which in itself is stiched together from different fragments of the dream, hence it looks like it makes no sense. Try reading a book while randomly stoping mid sentence and then randomly opening another page and continuing reading from another mid sentence, then switch fantasy book you are reading with some cooking book or IKEA manual... you get the idea.\n\nMy dreams are often fit with my current emotional state (which consists practicaly of hatred, wrath and just plain nothing). But sometimes, yes, i do dream about how it was before. At least once a month i have a dream about my classmate i had crush on, but i never expressed my feelings, it lasts for like allmost a decade alreay, can\'t remember though when it had started though, may be even more than that.\n\nDreams affect me a lot. Once i had one where i was screaming and yelling at some family members... well, after waking up fast forwards for less than an hour i was doing that, because of the feelings transfered from the dream were affecting me that much.', '14': 'Hi, was traipsing through my old comments and saw one from your post on Blunder Years and wondered if you had posted any more of your blunders. \n\nThis post struck me though. It is how I felt (and still do sometimes) a few years ago. It wasn\'t easy, but I\'m learning to get better. \n\nDon\'t feel like nobody wants to be your friend or doesn\'t want you around. It\'s just social anxiety. Mine had me convinced I was annoyingly effervescent and weird to the point of making people uncomfortable. I had to learn to think about how I feel about people. It wasn\'t ALWAYS negative. What I at least sometimes felt was pleasure and contentment. And I started to imagine that if I felt any endearment towards any people in my life, it\'s not a big leap to imagine at least some of them felt that way about me. \n\nWhen I started to get over the anxiety of the desire to be liked, I learned to accept people flaws and all. Previously for me it was very black and white. You could have singlehandedly put out a burning orphanage, but if you had an annoying habit, personality flaw, or lack of intelligence, I would still write you off. I had to learn to see the shades of grey in what makes a person ""worthy"" in my eyes. Unless someone is aggressively stupid or unfair, it\'s not okay to write them off as undeserving of respect. And I began to think maybe not everyone has that toxic mindset of picking out flaws. Maybe the lens I was imagining people focusing on my flaws was really my own lens looking back at me. \n\nAs for the fear of not having genuine feelings and the need to act out so I can feel SOMETHING... for me that mellowed on its own and I think it was because of not being so angry at others/myself over their ability to impress me. When I was constantly feeling actual anger at everyone for their perceived incompetence, or my own self loathing, it defined a new normal on the scale of feelings because that emotion was so intense. Being constantly at an 8/10 made the much more common 3 or 4/10 feel like nothing at all. Life is mostly 3\'s and 4\'s Learning to smell the roses and not hate their thorns meant letting go of the excess stress it caused. Now if I have just an average day, it isn\'t overshadowed by either positive or negative comparisons to emotions I\'ve dealt with recently.\n\nI don\'t know, I don\'t have all the answers and I\'m not even suggesting you take it as advice. Hell, I may be typing all of this just because it\'s helping me understand/measure that ***I*** am getting better. If I was trying to send a message, I guess that would be it. If my (string of self deprecating expletives) ass can find new ways to be better than my old self, it\'s got to be possible for others. \n\nRemember I said I had to imagine other people felt the way I do? Well know that I\'m out here, hoping you can do it. And if I can want good things for you, it\'s easy to imagine you could want good things for yourself, too\n\nI know from experience it can become this weird contest to imagine you have it worse than me and I am the rare lucky one, so that\'s why you think you can\'t get better. \n\nI\'d ask you not to do that to yourself. I used to do that too.\n\nP.S. For what it\'s worth, reading some of your comments here, you seem like a good person. And I know the internet cant tell you what someone is really like, but I can imagine someone like you and I being friends. ', '15': 'I relate to you so much. Just stagnation for the past 5 years, constantly being told how loved and \'valuable\' I am yet it never feels like that. I\'ve just wasted everyone\'s time, effort and money. I\'ve told people in the past when they\'ve asked me how I\'m doing that I\'m ""getting better"", but at this point it\'s almost just to avoid making *them* feel depressed, so I have to lie. My only salvation has been searching for truth, and adhering to my nature in both the sense that i take a natural approach to improving my health and also to just *try* to find things to love about myself.\n\nSomething I found that helps with basic self care i.e. washing myself is something I learnt from reading about the power of habits, and the ""willpower doesn\'t work"" principle. When you\'re in a state like we are, you don\'t have any willpower so it\'s a waste of time trying to exert some we don\'t have in order to get shit done. My therapist actually responded to my ideas that I need to improve myself through adversity, taking the hard route and just doing hard things, by saying that actually, although it may not sound so glorious, you have to take the easy route. What this means in practice is changing your environment to force you to make good choices, rather than trying and failing to use willpower to do so. So yeah, for getting washed and stuff, for the longest time I would spend days at a time in pyjamas after waking up, not washing because *what was the point.* But I realised that if I stopped wearing pyjamas to bed, I\'d basically have to get washed and dressed after waking up because I felt insecure in just pants, interacting with family members \\[as few and far between as those interactions might be.\\] So that\'s my small piece of advice, because being washed and dressed makes you \\[or at least it makes me\\] feel just that little bit better and less disgusted with yourself and the cycle of self-hatred is slowed down quite a bit.', '16': 'Self-hatred is what drives and sustains my own struggle with depression. Sometimes I hate myself so bitterly I\'m convinced that I\'m just a hateful person, who I do not want to be. Of course, I know *intellectually* I\'m not a hateful person, but I often doubt.\n\nMy single greatest weapon against hatred is forgiveness. Every day, especially those during which I most hate myself, I focus on forgiving myself. Most of the time it\'s incredibly difficult. But successfully forgiving oneself takes a little set up. I\'ll explain.\n\nYou yourself revealed you experience mental illness. That\'s an important fact. You are *in no way responsible* for the fact you\'re mentally ill. Everyone hates the word, ""victim,"" so I\'ll just point out that mental illness and all its effects are happening *to* you. You\'re not perpetrating them. That said, you certainly know in an objective sense that mental illness produces severe, sustained emotional distress above and beyond what people typically experience. Shit, dude, perfectly healthy people skate by most of the time. It seems you\'re focusing on those individuals who excel. They\'re real, yes. But most people? They do the bare minimum even without the especial hell of mental illness.\n\nSo, try to remember that *it makes sense* you\'re struggling to perform as a healthy person would. You\'re coping with tremendous anguish. *There is nothing wrong with you.*', '17': 'I have a job. I make xxxx(doesn’t matter) a year and try to provide for my family. We aren’t hurting for money, and I piss away any extra income that I have. I know it isn’t a smart move, but I do it. I’m not making excuses about it. \n\nMy brother makes about 250-300k a year.  He is my only sibling, and he’s older. He is unmarried, no kids, no potential spouse to speak of. \n\nMy father has been alive long enough to lose a wife of 20 years(my mother), and another wife of 20 years (my stepmother). He has lost most of his siblings to cancer (he had 10-12 siblings, and only had one brother left).  \n\nI have been under the shadow of my sibling since as far back as I can remember. Nothing I can do would be deemed as acceptable in my father’s eyes. He (father)Ike’s to find very passive-aggressive ways to remind me of this whenever possible.  \n\nThe only thing keeping me going is that if I were to end it all myself, my wife and child would be left without me, and they value me in ways that I am unable to comprehend. If it weren’t for the loss that I would leave my wife and father with, I would be gone already.  (my child is too young to understand)\n\n\nI get it, but we have to keep going on, even if it’s only to spare other people from grief. It’s a shitty reason, but it’s still a reason.

I feel a deep sense of fatigue and hatred inside of me. It's sick and dark, but extremely magnetic, addictive, powerful, and it hasn't left me.

It is a false hate, born from insidious machinations of depression, and it took me a very long time to realize this, about 10 years. \n\nThis was 2, maybe 3 years ago, and I was on the verge of breaking up with my boyfriend over text because of emotional issues going on at the time, to no one's surprise. We were going to spend a week together at the beach with my parents, but I told him to stay home and leave me be. He instead drove 3 hours to meet me and confronted me about why I was trying to end things in the first place, leading to a long discussion of my issues for the umpteenth time, and we both realized at that point that my irrational hatred for myself and desire to destroy was not of myself but of something more sinister, seeking to increase my own suffering using my body as a vessel.\n\nI describe it in such a way because imagining my depression as something separate, almost physical like a demon to be banished, helps me tune out the unending hatred I bear towards myself. The hatred is irrational, so instead of fighting fire with fire, I seek to live a life that gives me physical proof that I'm not a piece of shit, that I'm loved, and that I've lived well. The evidence I use to rationalize that I can't be as bad a person as I think, and therefore what I think is wrong. It's helped me shift perspectives from someone absolutely hating themselves all the time to someone who can at least take small pride in some things, who is at least somewhat okay with himself, and hopefully who will one day learn to like or even love himself. "", '1': ""On a personal level because I have no social status, no romantic prospects, no talents, no work ethic, no job, no friends, no life, and because im ignored, belittled, criticised, ostricised, shamed, laughed at and lied to more than anything else. Because I have no future in front of me and because of all the pain in the past behind me. \n\nOn a global level because human nature seems to be predominantly selfish and we seem to seek to dominate each other. I see a cycle of the strong subjugating the weak whether it's on the playground or in the office or on in a global geopolitical theatre. For which there is no resolution and which is just a characteristic of human behaviour. I even see it in myself and don't know whether to fight against my nature or to allow it. \n\nThen on a spiritual level questions regarding the nature of fear, pain, and life. Just exactly what are fear and pain and why do they carry this essence of evil within them? What is this universal undercurrent that I seem to detect running through the pitch black darkness of the night, and in the pain of my body breaking , and in the fear of everything that i seek to avoid, and in the insanity of a schizophrenic. Is it an illusion that's created by me putting all of these undesirables into the same category or does the evil itself exist beyond my own mind? Is it something that exists only within us or is it something inherent in the universe itself? In death am I destined to an eternity of oblivion or am I just a manifestation of the singular essence of life itself and will I emerge elsewhere in another form and body for another lifetime . And if all life is a universal manifestation of the same thing then am I as a type of life not intertwined with the very universe itself?

These days, I've developed a coping method (a defense mechanism) whose purpose is to ensure the fulfillment of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Rather than remain in a state of uncertainty whether or not someone will appreciate my company, I will go out of my way to purposely alienate them. Whenever I do this I have a great feeling of satisfaction. It is so seamlessly intertwined with my personality it blends in perfectly with my own introversion. Truth be told, I've never felt like I've had any meaningful relationships face to face. Currently I've maintained zero friendships with anybody outside of the internet and alienation is virtually the only thing I know how to do well. I'm consciously aware my attitude is inhibiting the development of any sincere connections (extending towards my own development as a person) from arising and yet I'm content, morbidly satisfied, with being vilified.   \n\nWelcome 2 da club."", '3': 'You are certainly not alone. And you are certainly dealing with (in my opinion, but its fact) one of the hardest, soul crushing, impossible to fully comprehend diseases you can get. Thats the reason talking to others that know can be the only relief from the extreme isolation and loneliness you feel regardless of how many people are around. It\'s an intense fight and even those who are in really deep at the moment. You are here, you are reading, you sometimes post and God dammit you are FIGHTING it. I have type 1 diabetes, got 90% of my colon removed when I was a kid so at 32 I\'m still in constant pain. Yet I would double those ailments if it meant I could have my life back with the 18 years of depression/anxiety/self-hatred wiped away. \n\nIt\'s that bad, and understandably hard to grasp if your preconceived notion of depression is having 1 bad day at the office.\n\nWe all need to have a huge discussion about the stigmatism polarized in a society that makes people in such bad shape feel ashamed and crazy because shit terms like ""mental health"" get thrown around like it\'s saying hello! I thought this was the era where progressive acceptance of taboo issues is to be fought for and understood in a more broad sense.\n\nThen why the FUCK is depression and mental health as a whole, one of the biggest underlying factors in so much shit that goes undiagnosed and creates habits or bad situations in literally all facets of life. Not only is it downplayed by media, shows, articles and soap box critics who need to insert a shitty false and triggering opinion they have no business talking about like its nothing.

In terms of age, job, financial position, weight? \n\nI\'m 28 and going through a major existential crises of complete confusion and despair. Most of my day is spent trying to bat of any feeling of deep insecurity. But strangely that has translated into only enjoying conversation with strangers. Although, they rarely happen as I developed anxiety. But when they do, I actually do enjoy them, after the initial feeling of ""fuck someone who is talking to me"". I don\'t have any friends, never been great at managing relationships anyway but over the last 2 years, I\'m just ashamed of who I am so it\'s much better to speak to strangers who don\'t know you, then those who have this image of who you used to be.  I used to love going out, meeting people being social. Now not so much. I find myself not amused by anything really. In the same way you do. For me it\'s again because I\'ve stacked up at 0 in my career, financially and in personal development. I\'m sure if those areas were recharged and replenished I would start enjoying life a bit more but at the moment it\'s all pretty much the same. Sub par mood, with continuous feelings of hate for who I\'ve become. Pretty awesome right. \n\nStupid question but how open are you creatively? Do you, maybe not now, but in the past, try new things? Whether it be hobbies or parts of life you never even thought about? I am super open and always have been. So for me, I\'ve tried this and unfortunately doesn\'t work consistently but I pick up a book or watch a doc or go to an exhibition about something I know nothing about. Like I said unfortunetly it hasn\'t worked for me in any sifnicant and meaningful way but sometimes I do get absorbed by a new topic area. I literally paid zero attention to politics and sociology, but recently find myself reading and watching a lot of content on things like ""left vs right"" or ""class structures"" or reasons for inequality. ', '5': 'I am actually glad that you posted this, because I feel the same way and I have never been able to express this to anyone or make anyone understand. When my depression got to it\'s worst point, this was what I thought about constantly- I couldn\'t be without something to occupy my mind because this is where my thoughts would drift and I would get terrified and feel like my head was spinning and feel nauseous. There were a million other problems I had/have due to my depression but this is probably the worst. It made it harder that everyone I have met, or communicated with who has depression doesn\'t fear death and doesn\'t obsess over the fear of death but rather wants to die/commit suicide etc. \nI will always say that I am a huge supporter of medication for depression for those who need it. It took me a couple of tries on meds, it\'s not the most fun process, but when I finally landed on the one that worked for me (wellbutrin), I noticed within weeks that the obsession over these thoughts diminished significantly. I was able to focus on my life because I wasn\'t constantly haunted with the thoughts. This was amazing to me because having the thoughts only contributes to the cycle of being depressed. \nI still have the moments, in the shower or laying in bed before falling asleep where I think about how everyone who is old always says ""life goes so fast,"" and it does go faster the more time goes on. I\'m terrified of aging because I know that it brings me closer to death. I dread the thought that one day I will be old and just awaiting my death, and I can\'t go back, can\'t change a thing, can\'t buy more time. \nPeople always say that you matter to others, and you\'ve made impacts in others lives, or that they needed you. That\'s true, and I am thankful that I have been there for those who needed me. It\'s hard to explain, but I still don\'t find that helpful at all because I think about how that only matters because we exist in the first place. If none of us existed it wouldn\'t matter at all. If those people hadn\'t been born it wouldn\'t matter at all. We exist solely to keep the race existing which feels meaningless to me. I often feel anger because we are living in a cruel world and I often resent the fact that I/humans were given a brain so capable of emotion, such deep thought, feeling so deeply, such a longing for meaning yet in the end we are never granted that (besides through religion, which doesn\'t work for me). \nThe thought of ceasing to exist in itself also terrifies me, the thought of not being, of not seeing what happens to the world, of simply turning to dust and hundreds of years later never being remembered. Even if souls remain and spirits exist, I fear watching years from a distance unable to speak with or touch my loved ones. Years and years in the future, the earth will be gone along with me and everything we ever did as humans here will no longer matter. \nI also wish many times that I was never born so I never had to feel these things. I refuse to have children for these reasons. I refuse to pass the depression and these feelings on to another human being, I wouldn\'t wish it upon anyone. That to me would be one of the most cruel things I could do. But I also refuse to have children because I feel that you spend your life getting attached to people who will eventually die. If nothing else takes you first, you have some good years. Then your grandparents or relatives die, your parents die, then your siblings may die before you. Whoever doesn\'t die before you is left with the sadness of losing you. So many people are obsessed with focusing their whole life on their career, years and years of education (Sometimes this makes people happy, education can make you happy, and that is awesome- I don\'t mean to put this down in all circumstances but many who go to college hate it- myself included). They waste their lives away, stressed out about work and money, only to make it to being old and now all your good years are gone. \nWhat I have gained that is positive from these thoughts is realizing that I should do what makes me happy because the time I have is short. When I am laying in my death bed I don\'t want to be thinking about what I should\'ve done, or shouldn\'t have, or how I should\'ve focused on the people I loved. Fuck what everyone else tells me I need to do to be happy- I don\'t need to have kids, I don\'t need to have a wildly successful career. If you\'re genuinely happy working at a grocery store and it pays your bills honestly who the fuck cares if everyone else is saying ""oh, that\'s not a career, that\'s not right, you should be somewhere else."" Never listen to anyone who says ""When I was your age I had x or y by now!"" It\'s a whole different playing field for this generation. I seek jobs and work that make me happy, or, at least, don\'t make me miserable. I refuse to stay in a job where I am miserable. I worked hard to get my credit to a good score so that I could take a vacation to Hawaii at 23 years old, and pay it off over a few months. Do whatever you can to do the things that make you happy while you are young. Traveling or whatever else makes you happy will be more difficult when you are old (When it\'s hard to walk, when you have tons of medications or who knows what else; a need for insulin, an oxygen tank). \nHopefully sharing how I feel didn\'t make you more depressed, I suppose the points I wanted to make are that there is no shame in medication or counseling. Don\'t let people who have never had depression try to tell you anything about it, how to fix it, or that it\'s invalid. Don\'t let them try and tell you things about medication, because at the end of the day, sure there are terrible problems with the pharmaceutical industry but antidepressants save lives in more ways than one. I highly recommend studying the psychology of depression/ how dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine etc. work. It helps you gain a great understanding that you are sick (just like someone with any other disease) and your brain doesn\'t work like other peoples instead of feeling ridiculous and invalid. And lastly, use every moment you have wisely, really do the things that make you happy. Don\'t let yourself be walked all over. Figure out how to realistically achieve your goals/happiness, because simply hearing ""life is great, you can do anything if you put your mind to it, this guy went from nothing to a millionaire so you can too!"" Doesn\'t help you feel motivated when you have depression at all. \nI wish you the best, you aren\'t alone!', '6': 'Fuck man you already know me on a personnal level.\nI mean I don\'t want to be cocky so let us not attribute that to intelligence, just a point lof view amongst others.\n\nThen again, about my small window frame, I try to enjoy that.\nLike I said, I go out, I do enjoyable things. But when it is over, I just feel like "" shit I still would rather die"".\nI already had some \'it is good to feel really alive moments\' , but they give me only small hope. I\'d like to be driven by such moments, to crave the little pleasures of life, the good moments.\n\nBut for some reason my mind sees life as an ocean of sadness and boredom with sprinkles of happinness inside. Heck, I know I won\'t be able to keep it up like this. I\'d like my parents to at least believe I am happy and well before they pass away. But it\'s like I can\'t. I can\'t cope with life.\n\nHow the hell did you do ? Did you like start doing a lot of productive things ? Kind of things that give you a hard time but end up really satisfying ?\n\nIf I was actually able to see what is going to happen next, wouldn\'t I be alarmed by the shit I am diving neck deep inside of ? Wouldn\'t I force myself to get my shit together ?\n\nBecause the only answers to that question I have is that I am a will-less husk of a weak person.\nI see people able to take 2 degrees at the same time, people able to work on a project 8 hours a day. How do you get motivated ? \nHow do you want to live life fully , with all the good and the bad ? How can people enjoy this shit ? Especially when 90% of all we do and go through is based upon a ton of lies ? There is no truth or meaning anymore , how can I forget this and just build my little cocoon of willingness and mitivation ?', '7': ""Therapy isn't about telling you how to fix your life. Usually CBT is about listening to you, showing a flaw or two of your thinking or how you come up with it and then letting you ahhhhhhhhh yourself. \n\nFor me, I had an abusive father and a substance addict mother with mental problems who left. For me, I was riddled with many different coping mechanisms and thought patterns that completely screwed me and my self esteem. By talking about certain things, my therapist was able to show me intellectually how just because they were my parents, they had flaws. Flaws that as an adult I can see, but the child in my brain thought of them as gods. That there was a reason my dad told me I'll never amount to much, and if I talked back he'd beat me with an inch of my life or I ruined all his hopes and dreams because I was born. Or a mother who didn't find me worthy enough to get help and left because it was easier. Showed me Maslow's hierarchy and was able to show me that this feeling of emptiness and pain I overcompensated with hard headedness and shifting my pain onto others and walls I have put up to protect myself. I think back on different parts of my life and if I would have been able to genuinely listen to him. I think because I felt genuinely broken, I faced my fears and wanted to hear what they had to say. I wanted to change. I wanted to break my walls. I don't know if it helps, I think stories can personally bring me a lot of realizations because it's like one of those Ad lib books, and I can see my story inside someone else's. I hope you feel better soon. \n\nEdit: clarity"", '8': 'Don’t ever be embarrassed to admit you have depression! I’ve suffered with ADD, Depression, and anxiety since I was little. My parents noticed and took me in to see a psychiatrist when I was 13 years old but I would lie to avoid being put on medicine. In the end it back fired because at 20 years old I had a mental break down. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. I would say the same thing how can I feel like this when I am truly blessed and have an amazing life. Now I am on medicine and finally found the right one after three years of being a lab rat. What I am getting to is it’s okay to be depressed, one we live in a crazy world but two depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain. Medicine will help level everything out and it’s good to start now so you can learn how to train your brain so eventually you won’t need medicine. If your parents don’t believe you tell them to go online and look up chronic depression. I always say the mind is more powerful than we think, and mental illness is a CHRONIC disease. Robert Williams for example, we all thought he was happy when he suffered from the terrible thoughts of depression. So take a deep breath, write all your feelings down and then read it to your parents. The best way for them to understand the thoughts going through your head is by telling them sometimes you feel life would be better without you. Don’t be afraid to cry, let it all out people who don’t suffer from mental illness won’t ever  understand but it’s real and they’re are facts to prove it. Everything will be okay and once you tell your parents it will feel like ten pounds lifted off your shoulders. If you ever feel hopeless and think life is better without you remember even though you’re sad you have a BIG heart which is very rare now in society.❤️❤️', '9': ""I've been considered good looking all my life, in my part of the world. To the point that I can see that people want something extraordinary from me, a miracle or something of that sort. I question every friendship I had. Was it because of my looks or there is some personality involved. Btw, this is a str8 dude talking. I got chicken pox last month and I feel much better now. My inner voice always identified with ugliness and I am actually ugly now. Just to tell you that I am struggling with the burden of attractiveness.\n\nYou know what, I would have told you the same thing, you look anorexic, as well, without spending a single calorie. No one, I mean exactly 0 number of people care about you. At least for me it it true. \n\nBe the best mother/father you can be, and do your best in your career, whatever it is or it is not.  Fuck these people. I don't think it is about how you look. I think it is about how you feel. Take your blanket off and show your daughter what bravery is. Show them your bones, and tell them that you have a place in this world just because you are kind to them. "", '10': ""Yeah, I came here to say chemically, no. I find it weird I never got addicted the self harm I did. Even a few finger nail sized scars though remind me of how low I was in terms of coping skills, I really am trying to moderate a bit what I say here because I have a lot of shame over it and hatred towards the act because of it, but self harm may make sense as a last resort coping skill, it also lowers the chances of learning better coping skills.\n\nI'm concerned, OP, that it's the only thing that makes you feel alive, because the rest of your life doesn't seem the best then. Better coping skills would speak to doing what you can in that regard. (Really, just what you can, this is a admonition over your life not being perfect. Heck, I really only branch out to get to good situations myself and have done little to fix or directly address the bad in my own life.)"", '11': "" &gt; but does anyone feel the same way I do?\n\n\nYes &amp; No.  No one feels the exact combination of feelings which you're feeling with that intensitiy for those reasons at this time.  In some sense your feelings are unique.  \n\nBut if you boil down those feelings to what they stem from, then yes, many people feel what you feel.  \n\nTo begin with many people find some degree of comfort in depression.  Depression has comforting traits.  It allows you to be in a safe space where you don't do new &amp; challenging things where you might be judged or rejected.  Depression is a reason that people stay in bed or in a comfortable (but wrong) relationship.  Yes, this is common.\n\n.  \n\nSecondly, most of what you described on motivation leads me to believe that anger gives you strenth when you can't find hope.  This is pretty substantial. It isn't the best case scenario but it also isn't the worst.  Also you mention that the things which it gives you strength to do are work out &amp; develop a personality. These particular goals are telling about your priorities.  Specifically whether you feel good enough.\n\n.\n\nTo wrap it up, yes *many* people have felt the way that you feel.  It does have benefits but the drawbacks to such powerful coping mechanisms are substantial.  Like any other coping mechanism, it is corrosive.  The longer you co-exist with it, the more damaging it is to the rest of your life.  Right now it's what you need to feel/do but you will get to a point that you'll ask yourself what it's all for.  Why work out and have an excellent personality if you don't trust women &amp; refuse to have a meaningful relationship?  Why promote suffering to become a stronger person if you have nothing in your life to fight for? Eventually all of this has to be *for something*.  That something *- whatever it is for you -* comes at the other side of treating the problems which are prompting these extreme coping mechanisms"", '12': 'That sounds like me, pretty close. I\'ve been diagnosed with depression and struggling with it for decades. So you could have depression, with those symptoms. Others here at r/depression have commented about having or reaching a level of depression that\'s below sad, where a person stops feeling much. It\'s more likely a person has depression if a person also has other symptoms of depression too, such as loss of interests and disrupted sleep patterns.\n\nSo I\'m reading your comment again, because I can\'t say for sure. Point by point, where are we similar or different?\n\nApologizing for posting or commenting, sometimes before getting to the point? Similar.\n\nClaiming to feel okay in general? Similar. If I think about how my body feels, it\'s usually okay, and that doesn\'t seem to have anything to do with emotions, it seems about my state of health and whether I\'m physically tired. It\'s a low chance at any minute that I\'m in the middle of feeling sad, which I would notice because I would be crying or feeling the symptoms of crying such as sore eyes or a lump in the throat. I might be in that state 0 minutes a day in some weeks, and averaging 30 minutes a day in other weeks when I\'m thinking about past problems in my life more. It\'s a lower chance I\'d be smiling or laughing in any minute. I usually wouldn\'t say that I ""feel happy"" as a way of describing it, if am in the middle of smiling or laughing that I may get for a few seconds in a day.\n\nThinking one has problems feeling anything or problems feeling anything strongly? Similar. I didn\'t realize this was a problem, because I just didn\'t know what other people meant by ""feeling."" I thought that my thoughts about situations and how those thoughts seemed to me, such as what tone of voice I would imagine expressing them in, was my emotions, and I thought everyone else was like that. Since I found out it\'s so different for other people, two months ago, I\'ve been trying to figure out what the difference is or what\'s going on with me. I think maybe the feelings that I would feel somewhere in my body, somehow, if I were more normal, are subliminal to me, so that I just know in my mind what my emotional reaction is to a thought in the minute or my mood is over an hour, but I don\'t literally ""feel"" it, unless there\'s a strong reaction such as crying. A reaction could be an expression of anger where if it\'s strong I\'ll get some tension in my gut and warmth in my face. Warmth in my face could be from embarrassment, or just anything. So I don\'t use the literal feeling as a way to tell what my emotion is. It wouldn\'t make sense that way. That would be totally unreliable. The literal feelings are just sensations of expressing something, which tells me that the emotion I already knew I was having in my mind is a strong emotion. Anger that\'s literally felt that much, that I\'m sure about, is maybe once a month.\n\nCrying about things read or seen? Not so similar. I\'ll cry if I think about how something I think or read or see relates to what\'s wrong in my life, or the life of someone I know. I\'d think it would be weird to cry about something in news or entertainment, without a personal connection or a personal thought about it. For instance, when I saw Titanic in a theater, I cried when all the people were falling off the ship into the water, because I thought life is like that: things are going along, then people die. When the movie tries to get people to cry with the little story about a romantic fling and which of those two characters dies or survives, that didn\'t matter as much to me.\n\nNot much behind crying or laughing? Similar for laughing, not similar for crying. When I\'m laughing, what\'s behind it is I noticed something funny, and that\'s unimportant. When I\'m crying, there are thoughts that are really important to me involved, that I can be concerned about as problems even if not crying.\n\nAfter laughing feeling the same as before? Similar, but what else would you expect? Seriously, is there supposed to be some effect? Is there supposed to be an effect on literal feelings, from laughing?\n\nCan stop crying at any moment? A little similar, but sometimes it\'s worse so it would take a minute to completely stop the expression of crying.\n\nNever getting angry or disappointed when something bad happens? Halfway similar. I\'ve noticed when I get angry is when there\'s something I\'m trying to do something very important and I have to deal with a computerized phone system that keeps making mistakes because it wants me to say something by voice, and I have to yell at it to be clear, and it still gets it wrong again and again, instead of just letting me press buttons. It\'s like they make those phone systems for important services with the intention of torturing people emotionally and messing with their lives. I never get angry that much at people in person. Disappointment is real, but it\'s in my mind. If you meant an emotion, I don\'t know, maybe if it leads to crying more because life is so awful.\n\nNot being able to care about people? No, I care enough to worry, and give people things when they need something. I cry about memories after someone I knew dies.\n\nNot feeling bad about never getting something wanted? Similar, halfway. Since wanting something is just a thought, and there are so many different things that a person could get or do in life, there\'s usually not any bad feeling about it, and I think that\'s the way it\'s supposed to be. However, if I think about how I\'ve missed out on doing certain things that other people almost all do, over so many years, and there seems to be something unfair about it, or some thought that it might never happen for me, then I may cry about it.\n\nNot knowing if one really enjoys activities or not? Similar.\n\nNot getting a ""good job"" feeling from one\'s brain? Similar. What does that even mean though? Do people get feelings from things they do, other than from the results? For instance, if a person cooks something, there can be a feeling from the result: tasting it and it tastes good. There\'s your feeling. Making music, you hear the music and it sounds like music. There\'s your feeling. Drawing, you finish a picture, and it looks like an interesting picture. There\'s your feeling. Why would you even expect anything else?\n\nNot knowing if all this is normal or wrong? Similar.\n\nI\'m sorry about how long this response is. It\'s like usual for me, what else am I going to do? I\'m not sure what I want. This subject of emotions seems important to me, so I write things that long for myself. Why not share it? It seems fair since you posted at a place that takes comments, so maybe you want a comment.', '13': '&gt;I know dreams are irrational and dont make sense (at least 95% of mine dont),\n\nThat\'s because we ""remember"" only small amount of it, which in itself is stiched together from different fragments of the dream, hence it looks like it makes no sense. Try reading a book while randomly stoping mid sentence and then randomly opening another page and continuing reading from another mid sentence, then switch fantasy book you are reading with some cooking book or IKEA manual... you get the idea.\n\nMy dreams are often fit with my current emotional state (which consists practicaly of hatred, wrath and just plain nothing). But sometimes, yes, i do dream about how it was before. At least once a month i have a dream about my classmate i had crush on, but i never expressed my feelings, it lasts for like allmost a decade alreay, can\'t remember though when it had started though, may be even more than that.\n\nDreams affect me a lot. Once i had one where i was screaming and yelling at some family members... well, after waking up fast forwards for less than an hour i was doing that, because of the feelings transfered from the dream were affecting me that much.', '14': 'Hi, was traipsing through my old comments and saw one from your post on Blunder Years and wondered if you had posted any more of your blunders. \n\nThis post struck me though. It is how I felt (and still do sometimes) a few years ago. It wasn\'t easy, but I\'m learning to get better. \n\nDon\'t feel like nobody wants to be your friend or doesn\'t want you around. It\'s just social anxiety. Mine had me convinced I was annoyingly effervescent and weird to the point of making people uncomfortable. I had to learn to think about how I feel about people. It wasn\'t ALWAYS negative. What I at least sometimes felt was pleasure and contentment. And I started to imagine that if I felt any endearment towards any people in my life, it\'s not a big leap to imagine at least some of them felt that way about me. \n\nWhen I started to get over the anxiety of the desire to be liked, I learned to accept people flaws and all. Previously for me it was very black and white. You could have singlehandedly put out a burning orphanage, but if you had an annoying habit, personality flaw, or lack of intelligence, I would still write you off. I had to learn to see the shades of grey in what makes a person ""worthy"" in my eyes. Unless someone is aggressively stupid or unfair, it\'s not okay to write them off as undeserving of respect. And I began to think maybe not everyone has that toxic mindset of picking out flaws. Maybe the lens I was imagining people focusing on my flaws was really my own lens looking back at me. \n\nAs for the fear of not having genuine feelings and the need to act out so I can feel SOMETHING... for me that mellowed on its own and I think it was because of not being so angry at others/myself over their ability to impress me. When I was constantly feeling actual anger at everyone for their perceived incompetence, or my own self loathing, it defined a new normal on the scale of feelings because that emotion was so intense. Being constantly at an 8/10 made the much more common 3 or 4/10 feel like nothing at all. Life is mostly 3\'s and 4\'s Learning to smell the roses and not hate their thorns meant letting go of the excess stress it caused. Now if I have just an average day, it isn\'t overshadowed by either positive or negative comparisons to emotions I\'ve dealt with recently.\n\nI don\'t know, I don\'t have all the answers and I\'m not even suggesting you take it as advice. Hell, I may be typing all of this just because it\'s helping me understand/measure that ***I*** am getting better. If I was trying to send a message, I guess that would be it. If my (string of self deprecating expletives) ass can find new ways to be better than my old self, it\'s got to be possible for others. \n\nRemember I said I had to imagine other people felt the way I do? Well know that I\'m out here, hoping you can do it. And if I can want good things for you, it\'s easy to imagine you could want good things for yourself, too\n\nI know from experience it can become this weird contest to imagine you have it worse than me and I am the rare lucky one, so that\'s why you think you can\'t get better. \n\nI\'d ask you not to do that to yourself. I used to do that too.\n\nP.S. For what it\'s worth, reading some of your comments here, you seem like a good person. And I know the internet cant tell you what someone is really like, but I can imagine someone like you and I being friends. ', '15': 'I relate to you so much. Just stagnation for the past 5 years, constantly being told how loved and \'valuable\' I am yet it never feels like that. I\'ve just wasted everyone\'s time, effort and money. I\'ve told people in the past when they\'ve asked me how I\'m doing that I\'m ""getting better"", but at this point it\'s almost just to avoid making *them* feel depressed, so I have to lie. My only salvation has been searching for truth, and adhering to my nature in both the sense that i take a natural approach to improving my health and also to just *try* to find things to love about myself.\n\nSomething I found that helps with basic self care i.e. washing myself is something I learnt from reading about the power of habits, and the ""willpower doesn\'t work"" principle. When you\'re in a state like we are, you don\'t have any willpower so it\'s a waste of time trying to exert some we don\'t have in order to get shit done. My therapist actually responded to my ideas that I need to improve myself through adversity, taking the hard route and just doing hard things, by saying that actually, although it may not sound so glorious, you have to take the easy route. What this means in practice is changing your environment to force you to make good choices, rather than trying and failing to use willpower to do so. So yeah, for getting washed and stuff, for the longest time I would spend days at a time in pyjamas after waking up, not washing because *what was the point.* But I realised that if I stopped wearing pyjamas to bed, I\'d basically have to get washed and dressed after waking up because I felt insecure in just pants, interacting with family members \\[as few and far between as those interactions might be.\\] So that\'s my small piece of advice, because being washed and dressed makes you \\[or at least it makes me\\] feel just that little bit better and less disgusted with yourself and the cycle of self-hatred is slowed down quite a bit.', '16': 'Self-hatred is what drives and sustains my own struggle with depression. Sometimes I hate myself so bitterly I\'m convinced that I\'m just a hateful person, who I do not want to be. Of course, I know *intellectually* I\'m not a hateful person, but I often doubt.\n\nMy single greatest weapon against hatred is forgiveness. Every day, especially those during which I most hate myself, I focus on forgiving myself. Most of the time it\'s incredibly difficult. But successfully forgiving oneself takes a little set up. I\'ll explain.\n\nYou yourself revealed you experience mental illness. That\'s an important fact. You are *in no way responsible* for the fact you\'re mentally ill. Everyone hates the word, ""victim,"" so I\'ll just point out that mental illness and all its effects are happening *to* you. You\'re not perpetrating them. That said, you certainly know in an objective sense that mental illness produces severe, sustained emotional distress above and beyond what people typically experience. Shit, dude, perfectly healthy people skate by most of the time. It seems you\'re focusing on those individuals who excel. They\'re real, yes. But most people? They do the bare minimum even without the especial hell of mental illness.\n\nSo, try to remember that *it makes sense* you\'re struggling to perform as a healthy person would. You\'re coping with tremendous anguish. *There is nothing wrong with you.*', '17': 'I have a job. I make xxxx(doesn’t matter) a year and try to provide for my family.

He is my only sibling, and he’s older. He is unmarried, no kids, no potential spouse to speak of. \n\nMy father has been alive long enough to lose a wife of 20 years(my mother), and another wife of 20 years (my stepmother). He has lost most of his siblings to cancer (he had 10-12 siblings, and only had one brother left).  \n\nI have been under the shadow of my sibling since as far back as I can remember.

Your post actually made a me feel a little better that I’m not the only one. My biggest weakness is doing multiple big things at once. Like I cannot handle school and work because my grades tend to suffer. I do great at the job though. But that’s not the place I really need exceed. And then I did school and tried to go through a process of getting into a sorority and that took up so much of my study time. Like honestly I was staying up till 4 in the morning just to study the stuff I have know for the sorority instead of using all that time to study for my classes. And currently I failed one of my class and I NEVER failed before. So I honestly don’t even know what’s the matter with me. I dropped out of the process being on the sorority after spring break but I still ended up failing the class. I’m honestly so lost because I don’t know what to do with the gpa I have now. And I don’t think I could tell my strict parents. It’s like another disappointment to them and especially to myself. \n\nBut I’m just going on a rant here. But all my saying is that you’re not alone. Cuz I feel like that almost everyday of my life. My friends work and still do well in school and I can’t do that. My friends are in all of these organizations and still have stellar grades. And I cannot handle that. \n\nSo we’re not alone I guess. But all I’m saying right now to myself is that everyone has different ways to live life. Others seem to be doing well than us but really they might also be dealing with something else as well. ', '1': ""I see a lot of people here saying they didn't finish school and such. I finished masters that takes 5 years in this east/central eu and it was waste of time. I can't get anything, there are no prospects and once I get something it will be a job someone with elementary school can do for pay that can't pay the bills with hours that resembles slavery. My father is such a hard working man I feel ashamed. Nobody was highly intelligent/ambitious or career oriented in my family but more like skilled worker class oriented. Meanwhile I am absolute horrible at everything manual/skilled and am not even good enough for intellectual jobs. I am going to feel shame until I die working in some retail with masters. On top of that I have physical problems, am ugly and have no friends. Now I am depressed mess which is ironic as i hold masters in psychology. Thought that if I learn excel and a bit of english I could at least work in some entry level finances somewhere in front of people but no. Such opportunites only go to people who know someone, the same as jobs in my field of study. I hope I die in my sleep, I should never study I should have just accepted that I come from worker class and be done with it being some janitor or factory labor."", '2': 'I am actually glad that you posted this, because I feel the same way and I have never been able to express this to anyone or make anyone understand. When my depression got to it\'s worst point, this was what I thought about constantly- I couldn\'t be without something to occupy my mind because this is where my thoughts would drift and I would get terrified and feel like my head was spinning and feel nauseous. There were a million other problems I had/have due to my depression but this is probably the worst. It made it harder that everyone I have met, or communicated with who has depression doesn\'t fear death and doesn\'t obsess over the fear of death but rather wants to die/commit suicide etc. \nI will always say that I am a huge supporter of medication for depression for those who need it. It took me a couple of tries on meds, it\'s not the most fun process, but when I finally landed on the one that worked for me (wellbutrin), I noticed within weeks that the obsession over these thoughts diminished significantly. I was able to focus on my life because I wasn\'t constantly haunted with the thoughts. This was amazing to me because having the thoughts only contributes to the cycle of being depressed. \nI still have the moments, in the shower or laying in bed before falling asleep where I think about how everyone who is old always says ""life goes so fast,"" and it does go faster the more time goes on. I\'m terrified of aging because I know that it brings me closer to death. I dread the thought that one day I will be old and just awaiting my death, and I can\'t go back, can\'t change a thing, can\'t buy more time. \nPeople always say that you matter to others, and you\'ve made impacts in others lives, or that they needed you. That\'s true, and I am thankful that I have been there for those who needed me. It\'s hard to explain, but I still don\'t find that helpful at all because I think about how that only matters because we exist in the first place. If none of us existed it wouldn\'t matter at all. If those people hadn\'t been born it wouldn\'t matter at all. We exist solely to keep the race existing which feels meaningless to me. I often feel anger because we are living in a cruel world and I often resent the fact that I/humans were given a brain so capable of emotion, such deep thought, feeling so deeply, such a longing for meaning yet in the end we are never granted that (besides through religion, which doesn\'t work for me). \nThe thought of ceasing to exist in itself also terrifies me, the thought of not being, of not seeing what happens to the world, of simply turning to dust and hundreds of years later never being remembered. Even if souls remain and spirits exist, I fear watching years from a distance unable to speak with or touch my loved ones. Years and years in the future, the earth will be gone along with me and everything we ever did as humans here will no longer matter. \nI also wish many times that I was never born so I never had to feel these things. I refuse to have children for these reasons. I refuse to pass the depression and these feelings on to another human being, I wouldn\'t wish it upon anyone. That to me would be one of the most cruel things I could do. But I also refuse to have children because I feel that you spend your life getting attached to people who will eventually die. If nothing else takes you first, you have some good years. Then your grandparents or relatives die, your parents die, then your siblings may die before you. Whoever doesn\'t die before you is left with the sadness of losing you. So many people are obsessed with focusing their whole life on their career, years and years of education (Sometimes this makes people happy, education can make you happy, and that is awesome- I don\'t mean to put this down in all circumstances but many who go to college hate it- myself included). They waste their lives away, stressed out about work and money, only to make it to being old and now all your good years are gone. \nWhat I have gained that is positive from these thoughts is realizing that I should do what makes me happy because the time I have is short. When I am laying in my death bed I don\'t want to be thinking about what I should\'ve done, or shouldn\'t have, or how I should\'ve focused on the people I loved. Fuck what everyone else tells me I need to do to be happy- I don\'t need to have kids, I don\'t need to have a wildly successful career. If you\'re genuinely happy working at a grocery store and it pays your bills honestly who the fuck cares if everyone else is saying ""oh, that\'s not a career, that\'s not right, you should be somewhere else."" Never listen to anyone who says ""When I was your age I had x or y by now!"" It\'s a whole different playing field for this generation. I seek jobs and work that make me happy, or, at least, don\'t make me miserable. I refuse to stay in a job where I am miserable. I worked hard to get my credit to a good score so that I could take a vacation to Hawaii at 23 years old, and pay it off over a few months. Do whatever you can to do the things that make you happy while you are young. Traveling or whatever else makes you happy will be more difficult when you are old (When it\'s hard to walk, when you have tons of medications or who knows what else; a need for insulin, an oxygen tank). \nHopefully sharing how I feel didn\'t make you more depressed, I suppose the points I wanted to make are that there is no shame in medication or counseling. Don\'t let people who have never had depression try to tell you anything about it, how to fix it, or that it\'s invalid. Don\'t let them try and tell you things about medication, because at the end of the day, sure there are terrible problems with the pharmaceutical industry but antidepressants save lives in more ways than one. I highly recommend studying the psychology of depression/ how dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine etc. work. It helps you gain a great understanding that you are sick (just like someone with any other disease) and your brain doesn\'t work like other peoples instead of feeling ridiculous and invalid. And lastly, use every moment you have wisely, really do the things that make you happy. Don\'t let yourself be walked all over. Figure out how to realistically achieve your goals/happiness, because simply hearing ""life is great, you can do anything if you put your mind to it, this guy went from nothing to a millionaire so you can too!"" Doesn\'t help you feel motivated when you have depression at all. \nI wish you the best, you aren\'t alone!', '3': 'I’ve had the same reaction when I was diagnosed with dysthymia and major depressive disorder, it hit me like a ton of bricks, I didn’t see it coming.\n\nI went to therapy to try to work some stuff out but i wasn’t expecting any real surprises, thinking I knew myself well enough.\nWhen I went to the psychiatrist for the first time I was very dismissive of his diagnosis, but it was my pride talking and my depression convincing me that really all I am is a loser and a failure who goes to the doctor to find more excuses.\n\nOnly recently I discovered how angry I am at myself, how difficult I made my life only by denying my mental state.\nIt got to a point where now I’m in the middle of everything, trying to repair all the damage I accumulated over the last 12 years, in all aspects you can think of.\n\nYou must remember you are human, whatever you’re suffering from, it can be overcome, it won’t be easy and it might never go away, but you can certainly cope with it.\n\nIf your parents are toxic people, they don’t deserve your time.\nYour ex best friend is not worth it, real friends stay even at your worst states.\nI made my best friend’s life a complete hell for years and he sticks by me to this day, even if he doesn’t know what to say to make me feel better.\nIt’s not the end,, it takes work and a lot of effort to turn the score but you can make it.\n I’m sure someday you’ll be proud of the progress you made, but now you must accept yourself, you are the only chance you get in this world so take care.\n\n\n\nAlso sorry for my bad writing, this isn’t my primary language\n', '4': 'Glad to hear that! \n\nThere is a certain bad feel when talking about taking meds and going to a psychiatrist but depression is also chemical and it messes up a lot of things. After talking to my psychiatrist we were discussing the amount of time it usually takes to treat depression. And he said it takes, usually, a minimum of 6-12 months. The meds are basically there to keep you running normal while you try with a psychologist/meditating/smoking/running/exercising/reading/getting a puppy/etc. I didn\'t like taking medicine until I understood/saw how much it helped me.\n\nVideogames are good but they can frustrate you even harder. I\'d look for a better gateway. This is on you though. Only you can discover what makes you fell better when really down. For me it is now marijuana. Once it was writing everything I was feeling on a piece of paper (or more). Once I listened to folk songs while I cried my heart out and by the end, I\'d get better. Once it was as simple as taking a hot shower/bath. This part is completely on you. \n\nSmoking mari. is good for me. You need to read about it before and see if you would like it. But principally think about legality, how to get it, the money, everything. Its effects may vary, I have a friend that once ate a space cake in amsterdan and got paranoid. That would be a disaster if that happened to you and you were alone. Which reminds me, smoking with someone else is good for the first time. \n\nOnly we know how much it helps when our parents understand and help us. My father always was more understanding. My mother took a little bit more but today they both are the best for me. Maybe your mother needs time or convincing of her own. She probably thinks it is your fault because she might never have been through the same.\nI don\'t know if you have a panic attack before but whenever someones says ""it\'s nothing. It\'s your fault. You are no trying"" I just ask if they have ever even been CLOSE to what we go through. \n\nIf your Dad gives you space, keep using it. I talk to mine every single day about 1-4 times. He keeps my fire burning so I can continue to fight. Keep yours burning too. If you need someone to put more gasoline so you can keep functioning pm me. I\'m going to sleep now. I\'ll enter tomorrow! Good night! Get better. \n\nBtw, crying outta nowhere. Typically depression. Did this twice today and I am taking meds. I meditated and it got better. There is a great meditation app that has anxiety focused meditations. It\'s called headspace. Anyways, see ya!', '5': ""I know how you feel. I have what outsiders would consider a good job (which I have to be thankful for given all those posts here on people who can't find a job), a husband that still likes me (again something I should be thankful for given all those talks about divorces), family that's supportive (well they are a 3hours flight away, but same difference), and I don't really have to worry about money (good saving, 0 debt). \n\nBut just like you said, I am casually suicidal too. I fantasize about self harm, I feel so indifferent about death. When I go to a funeral I wish I can give my years to the deceased, when I imagine my own death I don't feel particularly scared or worried.  I do small things that probably won't get me killed but might (not wear seat belts, walk into the road without looking, etc). \n\nI feel so guilty about my 1st world problem: depression but for no obvious reasons.\n\nI don't think typing this is helping you or me necessarily, but well, I guess now we both know we are not alone."", '6': 'I try to tell myself and my SO that people take stages of life at different times or in different orders. Most of my friends have children at 24. A third went directly into the workforce and I know a handful that got some kind of degree by now.\n\nI just remind myself that I\'m not at the worst place of my life. I try to take literally one day at a time and get a handful of things accomplished and then do some nice stuff for myself.\n\nI struggle with putting things off a lot. I know I do. So I try to get as much energy as possible (lots of sleep, energy drinks, throwing an inner dance party) and get shit done. That way I don\'t have to worry about my weakness- CAUSE EVERYTHING FOR THE DAY IS DONE.\n\nObviously this doesn\'t work every time but I try to set myself up to win instead of setting myself up to fail. Like getting 2 hrs of sleep- I know I won\'t be productive at all if I do this so I set alarms to let me know when to sleep and I stay with it. (Also can\'t over sleep though lol)\n\nMy SO has trouble with last minute plans and hates feeling trapped. He is working on it still- but looks are a big thing for him. So I try to remind him to groom the day before a scheduled event. That way from the time he wakes up until he absolutely has to go- everything is done and he can rock back and forth like the anxiety ridden hedgehog he is and calm himself down to do said planned thing.\n\nI\'m his hype man too. I am great as being positive- I\'m just not always responsible! :D   So he tells me ""no bad BlueNightmares, go to work"" and I tell him ""SHIT BRO YOUR HAIR LOOKS SICK"" and stuff.\n\nI try to remind ourselves that we are going to have fuck up days but its important we make an honest effort at least. Make a plan though that benefits the type of person you are.', '7': 'I’m just going to say this just to put it out there in your mind. I don’t expect it to change anything but maybe everything will add up in the future. Everyone is on their own personal journey and actual change takes awhile. I’ve been in and out of depression for too much of my young adult life. It’s exhausting and feeling like you cant go on is horrible. \n\nMy journey out of depression went like this. I came to terms with the fact that my life is what it is right now and it will never be perfect. I have one friend and basically don’t talk to any of my family. That sucks but thinking about it all the time does me no good. Just causes me anxiety and let’s my depression spiral. \n\nIf I’m feeling sad for no reason or a million other negative emotions I talk to myself in my head alittle. I explain to myself what I’m feeling, why I’m feeling this way or if there’s no reason and then I tell myself to ignore it. Acknowledge what your feeling because it’s not a bad thing to feel negative emotions to an extent. Next step is to motivate myself with positive things. Tell myself what my next step is going to be like getting out of bed. I keep trying even if it takes me an hour to work up the effort to shower. \n\nThrough my day to day life I keep motivating myself. Telling myself to enjoy the moment, it’s a privilege to be alive, it’s amazing we have the ability to contemplate life etc. Look at the sky more often clouds are beautiful and the changing of seasons is beautiful. Don’t worry about the past or present so much. We have to live in the now because that’s all we have right now. Try to be in control of your now happiness. Like I said at the start personal change takes awhile and it’s hard. Everyone deserve happiness and everyone deserves to take the steps towards happiness. I truly hope you find your happiness. \n\nAnother thing I stopped trying to be happy now I’m trying to be peaceful. Finding peace even in the shitty situations feels so good. The whole let negative emotions roll off you and embrace the positive ones. ', '8': 'Definitely! I had a really bad period of depression in college and was feeling the exact same way. If I had a purpose or someone else relying on me I could get stuff done, but if I didn’t I would be a puddle. Talked with my therapist about it and I ended up getting one! She’s the sweetest and silliest pup and still does a great job helping me when I’m feeling especially down. \n\nI would make sure that you know the full extent of taking care of a pup before making a commitment. They’re kind of like kids in the sense that you have to plan around them. They can’t be home too long by themselves and you have to figure out what to do with them if/when you are away overnight. \n\nAlso if you’re renting, check with your landlord and make sure you can have one. Even with a support animal letter from my therapist, I was in a battle for months with my landlord and eventually moved so I could get my dog.\n\nFinally, I would suggest getting a smaller breed of dog to start out! My pup is 45lbs. Not very big, but she’s definitely not a lap dog (even though she likes to act like one). I wouldn’t change anything about her, but if she didn’t exist I would have opted for a small dog. Smaller poops, smaller space they take up, easier to handle on walks, etc. \n\nFinally, look around! Don’t latch on to the first dog you see. Take your time. It’s about a 10 year commitment. We visited my pup several times before officially adopting her to make sure we were a good fit. \n\nBest of luck!', '9': 'I’m in a similar situation. I’ve been depressed since I was about 13/14 and I just turned 19 in October. I used to always feel the same way, bad most of the time with a few “happy” days/moments.\n\nNow I generally go between that numb state you’re talking about and a really horribly overwhelming sadness, but I don’t have any of those happy days anymore.\n\nI don’t think this is the better that people talk about. I think it’s just another phase of depression, for me at least. The people I’ve seen get better seem to genuinely be happy people.\n\nHave you tried counseling/therapy? Or medication? Personally I went to a few months of counseling but my counselor kind of sucked and I got no help out of it. I’m considering going back now because I’m really running out of ideas.\n\nPeople have told me that things won’t get better on it’s own, you have to work toward it and try to help yourself, which is the complete opposite of what I’ve done so I really should maybe take that advice. It’s just hard to make myself do things, even if it does help. You know? Maybe we should both try something new? Like a hobby or something. Maybe doing something a little different will push us in the right direction.\n\nGood luck my friend, I truly hope you find your happiness.', '10': ""i'm 30, highschool dropout and about to be fired, i wasted the last 10 years on games and the net.\n  \nIn that decade i learned a lot about depression, anxiety and about myself, i even went to a private psychiatrist for a while but it was far to expensive and not very useful at the time.\n\n Recently i have come to grips with the fact that the best i can hope for is a mediocre life and even that will take a lot of work, but that's not a bad thing.

What do you actually want to accomplish?  Do you want to pursue something specific or just something that will earn a decent living? Do you want to marry that girl? Have kids, a house? It's good to have a general plan and go from there.\n"", '11': 'When I read this post, I couldn’t believe the words. You were legit describing me too. All of the things you said, I used to do  and still do, somedays more and others less.\nNow I’m gonna tell you one thing about what you’re struggling with. You think you don’t Exert enough of your time, energy and thoughts to do the things you wanna do. It actually may seem like.\nBut when you described about energy being drained even by the activities you love, your brain is exerting a lot of force and thoughts to want you to enjoy it. It’s like “I need to enjoy this. I can’t not” and that energy spent is why you feel drained. It’s a sub-conscious act. \nI can give you a few tips that works for . Mind you, not everyday. Some days you will not enjoy anything, feeling numb and before you start any activity, you need to tell yourself that it’s okay if I don’t enjoy the thing that I loved. It’s okay if this doesn’t lift my mood. It’s okay, Truly. You’re gonna have good and bad days.\nStart with tiny activities. Go on a short walk, you don’t even have to go out. Just go to your terrace of just stand outside your house and listen to songs you find calming. Eat an ice cream when you don’t feel good. It’s okay to feel like you’re not okay. Find little activities that generally on their own require much work. \nGet a colouring book and go crazy, or just fill in whatever color you want slowly or just doodle on your book.  \nUse music to your advantage. That’s one thing that you don’t need. To do anything. You just have to play it and even if you don’t pay attention, your brain will register it. Play nature sounds, they have apps for this and so many YouTube videos.\nOr if you don’t feel like doing anything, just lie down and rest or do nothings it’s really okay. You need to give yourself permission to feel what you feel when it’s hard. Be kind to yourself.\nI won’t say by all this everyday is gonna be a blast, but you’re gonna have good days and those good days where you start the flicker of feeling alive, it’s worth any bad day that you’ll experience, even if you can’t see that on the bad days. ', '12': 'I know how you feel, and it doesn’t help when people who don’t understand tell you what they  think you should do, like it’s so easy if you just did this you wouldn’t be depressed, ugh, why didn’t I think of that? However, depression is disorder to be managed and it’s taken me a long time (and lots of therapy) to realize that there are certain things  I must force myself to do to stay one step ahead of this disorder lest I travel down the rabbit hole of despair. There is no one thing that will help, it’s a combination of things and doing them regularly. I get that it’s hard...and when depressed we reject things that we like, and things that are good for us. I also dislike when people tell me what to do, especially when they don’t suffer from the same disorder.  Sometimes the walk, yoga, healthy stuff is just not going to happen that day and it all feels so overwhelming and yes, like I’m failing. But I’ve also learned to recognize that forcing myself to do things that I know are good for me do help in the long run, even if they are hard and it feels like my legs have cement on them. I’m not even talking about a run but just a short walk outside, getting dressed has been hard before, things that are simple for others seem impossible. I talk myself through it, slowly, one step at a time. I’ve actually gone to the gym and just mindlessly gone on the elliptical, I was having some suicidal thoughts one night, having a rough time, I was getting worried, called a friend, he didn’t answer, and then called a hotline to find out it was disconnected....FmL...I was pacing around the house, anxiety was sky high, and I decided I needed to help myself before things got worse, I went to the gym and got on the elliptical and just angry worked out for 20 min. Didn’t make eye contact with anyone, had my headphones in, It was mindless, but I got my body moving and it got my head out of that pattern of beating myself up and ruminating. I have kicked and screamed and cried about how I don’t want to do these things, I don’t feel like doing them, they aren’t going to help, but then after I’ve been doing them consistently I do feel slightly better and the cloud lifts for a bit and I can see the benefit. It’s about self care and going through the motions even if it’s slow and painful. I have a mental health checklist that  some days I just look at, other days/weeks I put to good use and make my self care a priority. The right amount of sleep, a little exercise, some food, some fun stuff, some meditation or quiet time. Managing depression is not easy, do what works for you, and don’t let those other people who have no clue tell you how to “fix” it.  Find something you can tolerate as far as a little bit of exercise or movement and try to find things to do that bring you enjoyment. It’s a constant fight and sometimes all I want to do is sleep too. ', '13': 'I’m like this too now. I am just so numb from past trauma that I don’t feel anything or want to do anything anymore. I can barely even bring myself to type this up rn. I try so hard to keep moving forward because I of the people I love but it’s just so overwhelming sometimes, especially when it feels like your nervous system is attacking itself, and my psych won’t do shit about it, even though she’s the one who caused permanent damage in the first place and made me convulse and hallucinate by ripping me off multiple meds at once and throwing me on the MAX dose of not one, but TWO antidepressants all at once during a time in my life where I was basically suicidal. Fucking bitch.. Plus, I was only 17 at the time it happened. It ruined my fucking life, and now I can’t socialize because I’m too fucked up to function in this world.\n\n Anyways.. venting a bit there; but I feel your pain and want you to know you’re not alone. I want to exercise, I want to make money, I want to talk to women, I want to be able to love again, but I just don’t. There’s no logical reason why that I can think of, I just don’t. I understand that logically, you have to face your fears to *truly* become comfortable in your own skin, and that comfort is just an allusion, but it’s like my mind has just said fuck it and given up. I used to face my fears. The anxiety wasn’t fun but I was still able to get through it. Now I just don’t care at all. Having to be really self aware along with being a kid with sensory issues and a handful of mental disorders is not helping the situation at all. I am just hoping for something at this point, although I don’t know what that could be. \n\n I wish you the best of luck and I sincerely hope that you get better and find that natural drive to do things again. I am so sick of seeing many people suffering for no good reason.', '14': 'It\'s ok bro, I did not start working until I was 21 in last November. I\'m about to turn 22 now. I am still working on my GED, almost done right now once I finish the geometry chapter. I feel you. 19 is nothing, 21 is though lol. I get what you mean by:\n\n&gt; but the adult world just seems so far fetched and advanced\n\nIt\'s not. Everyone is a bunch of big children trying to present an image of something higher. There is no higher. We are children inside forever. People don\'t give a fuck, we are all in this weird crazy game and confused. Things go smooth and natural because of that. Nothing to be scared of.\n\n&gt;I am having a problem with what kind of job I’d like to get\n\nStop thinking about it from this stressful perspective. To do that, get any job you can; apply for a supermarket or whatever. Basically any job will give you real world experience and a more complete understanding of life, and then you can think more realistically when you get a deeper understanding of the value of time etc.\n\n&gt;but at the same time you want to enjoy what you’re doing right?\n\nThis is an excuse. You should instead think like so: ""I will probably enjoy any job that comes to me."" -- I push supermarket carts for a living, it\'s bad for my back and the pay is shit of course, but it\'s a very enjoyable job for me. Everyone tells me they hate that or it sounds shit. People love to be haters, but being a hater is childish &amp; inferior to acceptance of what you have. And hey, I may not be known for superficial things like creating a fuckin\' movie and making $2 billion, but I\'m known for being a really great hearted kind cool person, what really matters.\n\nMy advice is stop giving so much of a shit. That\'s good that you want to get a job that serves importance to the world -- but so what? The vast majority of people, intelligent or not, are forced to work shitty jobs before they can do what they want to do. I think if you just get a shitty job and start small from there, your mind will be clearer.', '15': ""Count me in. I'm not against my relatives/cousins/anyone except my parents, but I just prefer to stay away from them. Just be in a small circle where it consists of my parents, best friends and very closed ones. However, my family is only me, mom and dad. So, if any good-hearted/kind guests visits me and my family, haves a good chat, or even maybe stays for a couple of days or weeks, then he/she finally leaves the house, the whole environment will be quiet. Three of us will be like, mourning that happy moments we all just had few hours/days ago, but then few after hours things will get back to normal. This feeling was even worse for me, back then i was overcoming with existential crisis, would cry, within and out. This went on for about several years, it was hell, thinking bout all these 'existence' shit. Even though things are better, I'd always worry bout the future, about the events that will happen for sure."", '16': ""Take time to grieve. It's ok to feel these feelings and they will go away in that they will become memories of a good dog and some hard lessons learned. Life sometimes just sucks. You did all that you could when you realized she was missing.\n\nI have a similar story though not quite as traumatic. When I rented my house it came with a kitty. An outdoor kitty. Wimbly. Wimbly wasn't quite right in the head. It took a long time to get her to come to me and be hand fed a few treats.  She never left my small yard and lived under the house.  I travelled a lot for work which was no big deal. I had a vacation feeder filled with food for her. After a long trip and a LONG flight home from China I got home to hear Wimbly crying under the house. I had never heard Wimbly make a sound before. It was 4:00 am, cold and Wimbly wasn't much for letting me approach her anyway and it wasn't very easy to get under the house. The next day I didn't see her but that was typical. Another day went by, I got a little worried. Then day three I crawled under the house and poor Wimbly was no longer with us. I laid in the dirt under the house. I had heard her crying under the house...\n\nI buried her in the yard. I did my best to care for Wimbly, but sometimes is just doesn't work out.\n\nit will take time to heal, but you will heal. You will come to terms with what happened and make peace with your part in it."", '17': 'It’s ok man. Your parents mean well, it’s  just that they don’t know how to handle your problem and it frustrates them. It’s ok. Thy only want to help.\n\nI’ve been going through the same shit. I have friends, people want to talk to me, people at my workplace love me, I have a great gf who loves me and helps me, but somehow being at the best place I’ve ever been at, I still feel shitty every day. It’s like I got some weird fog of negativity in my brain that wouldn’t let go. I feel like I’ve gone mad but it’s just a symptom of anxiety and depression.\n\nThere is hope though. Yesterday I had good time around my girlfriend. After months of suffering, feeling like I’m not interesting or good enough for her, we went out and I enjoyed it. Of course my brain literally tries to force me to think I wasn’t having fun but I remember telling myself yesterday that this is what’s going to happen.\n\n\nThe truth is, hapiness is indeed a choice. People think it’s cliche but it really isn’t. It’s just not as simple as you think. You see, your brain is used to think negatively, for one reason or another. It feels so, so natural for us that we barely even notice it. It is wired so. When I say “hapiness is a choice”, I mean that hapiness is perspective. Hapiness is realizing that our brains are this way, and that we can choose to try and think in a different way. Not the “think happy!” Bullshit, but instead, looking at how your thoughts are irrational (some of them at least), and realizing that a different perspective can be taken. It’s that simple but also tough as fuck, since you’re pretty much wired to believe something else. It’s hard but it’s doable, and the fact I had fun with my girlfriend, that we shared a wholesome laugh in my car at a Thursday night, proves it for me. \n\nYou don’t have to go through this alone. I can’t. I have a book, called “feeing good”, which I’m reading (it’s cognitive therapy, basically what I described above), and it’s supposed to help with depression and anxiety (and it did work a bit), but I have so many questions and sometimes I get stuck in my mind or sometimes I just need to talk it out loud instead of thinking about everything which gives me a clearer perspective on what’s going on in my head. That’s where a therapist comes in handy. You said in the comments you’re going to one, and I think it’s great. I have 2, one which really helps me and moves things forward, and one who actually doesn’t do much but listen, though I love her because I just talk for an hour about all the shit in my life and I feel better letting it all out 😁\n\nAnyways, stay strong fella. Our lives can be awesome but at the end of the day, hapiness is determined by how we interpret situations. It’s discipline and a bit of work, but nothin undoable. People have gotten out of depression, people have lead good lives, you’re not alone in this.

Your post actually made a me feel a little better that I’m not the only one. My biggest weakness is doing multiple big things at once. Like I cannot handle school and work because my grades tend to suffer. I do great at the job though. But that’s not the place I really need exceed. And then I did school and tried to go through a process of getting into a sorority and that took up so much of my study time. Like honestly I was staying up till 4 in the morning just to study the stuff I have know for the sorority instead of using all that time to study for my classes. And currently I failed one of my class and I NEVER failed before. So I honestly don’t even know what’s the matter with me. I dropped out of the process being on the sorority after spring break but I still ended up failing the class. I’m honestly so lost because I don’t know what to do with the gpa I have now. And I don’t think I could tell my strict parents. It’s like another disappointment to them and especially to myself. \n\nBut I’m just going on a rant here. But all my saying is that you’re not alone. Cuz I feel like that almost everyday of my life. My friends work and still do well in school and I can’t do that. My friends are in all of these organizations and still have stellar grades. And I cannot handle that. \n\nSo we’re not alone I guess. But all I’m saying right now to myself is that everyone has different ways to live life. Others seem to be doing well than us but really they might also be dealing with something else as well. ', '1': ""I see a lot of people here saying they didn't finish school and such. I finished masters that takes 5 years in this east/central eu and it was waste of time. I can't get anything, there are no prospects and once I get something it will be a job someone with elementary school can do for pay that can't pay the bills with hours that resembles slavery. My father is such a hard working man I feel ashamed. Nobody was highly intelligent/ambitious or career oriented in my family but more like skilled worker class oriented. Meanwhile I am absolute horrible at everything manual/skilled and am not even good enough for intellectual jobs. I am going to feel shame until I die working in some retail with masters. On top of that I have physical problems, am ugly and have no friends. Now I am depressed mess which is ironic as i hold masters in psychology. Thought that if I learn excel and a bit of english I could at least work in some entry level finances somewhere in front of people but no. Such opportunites only go to people who know someone, the same as jobs in my field of study. I hope I die in my sleep, I should never study I should have just accepted that I come from worker class and be done with it being some janitor or factory labor."", '2': 'I am actually glad that you posted this, because I feel the same way and I have never been able to express this to anyone or make anyone understand. When my depression got to it\'s worst point, this was what I thought about constantly- I couldn\'t be without something to occupy my mind because this is where my thoughts would drift and I would get terrified and feel like my head was spinning and feel nauseous. There were a million other problems I had/have due to my depression but this is probably the worst. It made it harder that everyone I have met, or communicated with who has depression doesn\'t fear death and doesn\'t obsess over the fear of death but rather wants to die/commit suicide etc. \nI will always say that I am a huge supporter of medication for depression for those who need it. It took me a couple of tries on meds, it\'s not the most fun process, but when I finally landed on the one that worked for me (wellbutrin), I noticed within weeks that the obsession over these thoughts diminished significantly. I was able to focus on my life because I wasn\'t constantly haunted with the thoughts. This was amazing to me because having the thoughts only contributes to the cycle of being depressed. \nI still have the moments, in the shower or laying in bed before falling asleep where I think about how everyone who is old always says ""life goes so fast,"" and it does go faster the more time goes on. I\'m terrified of aging because I know that it brings me closer to death. I dread the thought that one day I will be old and just awaiting my death, and I can\'t go back, can\'t change a thing, can\'t buy more time. \nPeople always say that you matter to others, and you\'ve made impacts in others lives, or that they needed you. That\'s true, and I am thankful that I have been there for those who needed me. It\'s hard to explain, but I still don\'t find that helpful at all because I think about how that only matters because we exist in the first place. If none of us existed it wouldn\'t matter at all. If those people hadn\'t been born it wouldn\'t matter at all. We exist solely to keep the race existing which feels meaningless to me. I often feel anger because we are living in a cruel world and I often resent the fact that I/humans were given a brain so capable of emotion, such deep thought, feeling so deeply, such a longing for meaning yet in the end we are never granted that (besides through religion, which doesn\'t work for me). \nThe thought of ceasing to exist in itself also terrifies me, the thought of not being, of not seeing what happens to the world, of simply turning to dust and hundreds of years later never being remembered. Even if souls remain and spirits exist, I fear watching years from a distance unable to speak with or touch my loved ones. Years and years in the future, the earth will be gone along with me and everything we ever did as humans here will no longer matter. \nI also wish many times that I was never born so I never had to feel these things. I refuse to have children for these reasons. I refuse to pass the depression and these feelings on to another human being, I wouldn\'t wish it upon anyone. That to me would be one of the most cruel things I could do. But I also refuse to have children because I feel that you spend your life getting attached to people who will eventually die. If nothing else takes you first, you have some good years. Then your grandparents or relatives die, your parents die, then your siblings may die before you. Whoever doesn\'t die before you is left with the sadness of losing you. So many people are obsessed with focusing their whole life on their career, years and years of education (Sometimes this makes people happy, education can make you happy, and that is awesome- I don\'t mean to put this down in all circumstances but many who go to college hate it- myself included). They waste their lives away, stressed out about work and money, only to make it to being old and now all your good years are gone. \nWhat I have gained that is positive from these thoughts is realizing that I should do what makes me happy because the time I have is short. When I am laying in my death bed I don\'t want to be thinking about what I should\'ve done, or shouldn\'t have, or how I should\'ve focused on the people I loved. Fuck what everyone else tells me I need to do to be happy- I don\'t need to have kids, I don\'t need to have a wildly successful career. If you\'re genuinely happy working at a grocery store and it pays your bills honestly who the fuck cares if everyone else is saying ""oh, that\'s not a career, that\'s not right, you should be somewhere else."" Never listen to anyone who says ""When I was your age I had x or y by now!"" It\'s a whole different playing field for this generation. I seek jobs and work that make me happy, or, at least, don\'t make me miserable. I refuse to stay in a job where I am miserable. I worked hard to get my credit to a good score so that I could take a vacation to Hawaii at 23 years old, and pay it off over a few months. Do whatever you can to do the things that make you happy while you are young. Traveling or whatever else makes you happy will be more difficult when you are old (When it\'s hard to walk, when you have tons of medications or who knows what else; a need for insulin, an oxygen tank). \nHopefully sharing how I feel didn\'t make you more depressed, I suppose the points I wanted to make are that there is no shame in medication or counseling. Don\'t let people who have never had depression try to tell you anything about it, how to fix it, or that it\'s invalid. Don\'t let them try and tell you things about medication, because at the end of the day, sure there are terrible problems with the pharmaceutical industry but antidepressants save lives in more ways than one. I highly recommend studying the psychology of depression/ how dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine etc. work. It helps you gain a great understanding that you are sick (just like someone with any other disease) and your brain doesn\'t work like other peoples instead of feeling ridiculous and invalid. And lastly, use every moment you have wisely, really do the things that make you happy. Don\'t let yourself be walked all over. Figure out how to realistically achieve your goals/happiness, because simply hearing ""life is great, you can do anything if you put your mind to it, this guy went from nothing to a millionaire so you can too!"" Doesn\'t help you feel motivated when you have depression at all. \nI wish you the best, you aren\'t alone!', '3': 'I’ve had the same reaction when I was diagnosed with dysthymia and major depressive disorder, it hit me like a ton of bricks, I didn’t see it coming.\n\nI went to therapy to try to work some stuff out but i wasn’t expecting any real surprises, thinking I knew myself well enough.\nWhen I went to the psychiatrist for the first time I was very dismissive of his diagnosis, but it was my pride talking and my depression convincing me that really all I am is a loser and a failure who goes to the doctor to find more excuses.\n\nOnly recently I discovered how angry I am at myself, how difficult I made my life only by denying my mental state.\nIt got to a point where now I’m in the middle of everything, trying to repair all the damage I accumulated over the last 12 years, in all aspects you can think of.\n\nYou must remember you are human, whatever you’re suffering from, it can be overcome, it won’t be easy and it might never go away, but you can certainly cope with it.\n\nIf your parents are toxic people, they don’t deserve your time.\nYour ex best friend is not worth it, real friends stay even at your worst states.\nI made my best friend’s life a complete hell for years and he sticks by me to this day, even if he doesn’t know what to say to make me feel better.\nIt’s not the end,, it takes work and a lot of effort to turn the score but you can make it.\n I’m sure someday you’ll be proud of the progress you made, but now you must accept yourself, you are the only chance you get in this world so take care.\n\n\n\nAlso sorry for my bad writing, this isn’t my primary language\n', '4': 'Glad to hear that! \n\nThere is a certain bad feel when talking about taking meds and going to a psychiatrist but depression is also chemical and it messes up a lot of things. After talking to my psychiatrist we were discussing the amount of time it usually takes to treat depression. And he said it takes, usually, a minimum of 6-12 months. The meds are basically there to keep you running normal while you try with a psychologist/meditating/smoking/running/exercising/reading/getting a puppy/etc. I didn\'t like taking medicine until I understood/saw how much it helped me.\n\nVideogames are good but they can frustrate you even harder. I\'d look for a better gateway. This is on you though. Only you can discover what makes you fell better when really down. For me it is now marijuana. Once it was writing everything I was feeling on a piece of paper (or more). Once I listened to folk songs while I cried my heart out and by the end, I\'d get better. Once it was as simple as taking a hot shower/bath. This part is completely on you. \n\nSmoking mari. is good for me. You need to read about it before and see if you would like it. But principally think about legality, how to get it, the money, everything. Its effects may vary, I have a friend that once ate a space cake in amsterdan and got paranoid. That would be a disaster if that happened to you and you were alone. Which reminds me, smoking with someone else is good for the first time. \n\nOnly we know how much it helps when our parents understand and help us. My father always was more understanding. My mother took a little bit more but today they both are the best for me. Maybe your mother needs time or convincing of her own. She probably thinks it is your fault because she might never have been through the same.\nI don\'t know if you have a panic attack before but whenever someones says ""it\'s nothing. It\'s your fault. You are no trying"" I just ask if they have ever even been CLOSE to what we go through. \n\nIf your Dad gives you space, keep using it. I talk to mine every single day about 1-4 times.

I don’t expect it to change anything but maybe everything will add up in the future. Everyone is on their own personal journey and actual change takes awhile. I’ve been in and out of depression for too much of my young adult life. It’s exhausting and feeling like you cant go on is horrible. \n\nMy journey out of depression went like this. I came to terms with the fact that my life is what it is right now and it will never be perfect. I have one friend and basically don’t talk to any of my family. That sucks but thinking about it all the time does me no good. Just causes me anxiety and let’s my depression spiral. \n\nIf I’m feeling sad for no reason or a million other negative emotions I talk to myself in my head alittle. I explain to myself what I’m feeling, why I’m feeling this way or if there’s no reason and then I tell myself to ignore it. Acknowledge what your feeling because it’s not a bad thing to feel negative emotions to an extent. Next step is to motivate myself with positive things. Tell myself what my next step is going to be like getting out of bed. I keep trying even if it takes me an hour to work up the effort to shower. \n\nThrough my day to day life I keep motivating myself. Telling myself to enjoy the moment, it’s a privilege to be alive, it’s amazing we have the ability to contemplate life etc. Look at the sky more often clouds are beautiful and the changing of seasons is beautiful. Don’t worry about the past or present so much. We have to live in the now because that’s all we have right now. Try to be in control of your now happiness. Like I said at the start personal change takes awhile and it’s hard. Everyone deserve happiness and everyone deserves to take the steps towards happiness. I truly hope you find your happiness. \n\nAnother thing I stopped trying to be happy now I’m trying to be peaceful. Finding peace even in the shitty situations feels so good. The whole let negative emotions roll off you and embrace the positive ones. ', '8': 'Definitely! I had a really bad period of depression in college and was feeling the exact same way. If I had a purpose or someone else relying on me I could get stuff done, but if I didn’t I would be a puddle. Talked with my therapist about it and I ended up getting one! She’s the sweetest and silliest pup and still does a great job helping me when I’m feeling especially down. \n\nI would make sure that you know the full extent of taking care of a pup before making a commitment. They’re kind of like kids in the sense that you have to plan around them. They can’t be home too long by themselves and you have to figure out what to do with them if/when you are away overnight. \n\nAlso if you’re renting, check with your landlord and make sure you can have one. Even with a support animal letter from my therapist, I was in a battle for months with my landlord and eventually moved so I could get my dog.\n\nFinally, I would suggest getting a smaller breed of dog to start out! My pup is 45lbs. Not very big, but she’s definitely not a lap dog (even though she likes to act like one). I wouldn’t change anything about her, but if she didn’t exist I would have opted for a small dog. Smaller poops, smaller space they take up, easier to handle on walks, etc. \n\nFinally, look around! Don’t latch on to the first dog you see. Take your time. It’s about a 10 year commitment. We visited my pup several times before officially adopting her to make sure we were a good fit. \n\nBest of luck!', '9': 'I’m in a similar situation. I’ve been depressed since I was about 13/14 and I just turned 19 in October. I used to always feel the same way, bad most of the time with a few “happy” days/moments.\n\nNow I generally go between that numb state you’re talking about and a really horribly overwhelming sadness, but I don’t have any of those happy days anymore.\n\nI don’t think this is the better that people talk about. I think it’s just another phase of depression, for me at least. The people I’ve seen get better seem to genuinely be happy people.\n\nHave you tried counseling/therapy? Or medication? Personally I went to a few months of counseling but my counselor kind of sucked and I got no help out of it. I’m considering going back now because I’m really running out of ideas.\n\nPeople have told me that things won’t get better on it’s own, you have to work toward it and try to help yourself, which is the complete opposite of what I’ve done so I really should maybe take that advice. It’s just hard to make myself do things, even if it does help. You know? Maybe we should both try something new? Like a hobby or something. Maybe doing something a little different will push us in the right direction.\n\nGood luck my friend, I truly hope you find your happiness.', '10': ""i'm 30, highschool dropout and about to be fired, i wasted the last 10 years on games and the net.\n  \nIn that decade i learned a lot about depression, anxiety and about myself, i even went to a private psychiatrist for a while but it was far to expensive and not very useful at the time.\n\n Recently i have come to grips with the fact that the best i can hope for is a mediocre life and even that will take a lot of work, but that's not a bad thing. I did actually ruined my life to a significant degree, but most of it is fixable with time and effort. \n\nI suggest you take a step back and take honest look on your career prospects and your future in general. What do you actually want to accomplish?  Do you want to pursue something specific or just something that will earn a decent living? Do you want to marry that girl? Have kids, a house? It's good to have a general plan and go from there.\n"", '11': 'When I read this post, I couldn’t believe the words. You were legit describing me too. All of the things you said, I used to do  and still do, somedays more and others less.\nNow I’m gonna tell you one thing about what you’re struggling with. You think you don’t Exert enough of your time, energy and thoughts to do the things you wanna do. It actually may seem like.\nBut when you described about energy being drained even by the activities you love, your brain is exerting a lot of force and thoughts to want you to enjoy it. It’s like “I need to enjoy this. I can’t not” and that energy spent is why you feel drained. It’s a sub-conscious act. \nI can give you a few tips that works for . Mind you, not everyday. Some days you will not enjoy anything, feeling numb and before you start any activity, you need to tell yourself that it’s okay if I don’t enjoy the thing that I loved. It’s okay if this doesn’t lift my mood. It’s okay, Truly. You’re gonna have good and bad days.\nStart with tiny activities. Go on a short walk, you don’t even have to go out. Just go to your terrace of just stand outside your house and listen to songs you find calming. Eat an ice cream when you don’t feel good. It’s okay to feel like you’re not okay. Find little activities that generally on their own require much work. \nGet a colouring book and go crazy, or just fill in whatever color you want slowly or just doodle on your book.  \nUse music to your advantage. That’s one thing that you don’t need. To do anything. You just have to play it and even if you don’t pay attention, your brain will register it. Play nature sounds, they have apps for this and so many YouTube videos.\nOr if you don’t feel like doing anything, just lie down and rest or do nothings it’s really okay. You need to give yourself permission to feel what you feel when it’s hard. Be kind to yourself.\nI won’t say by all this everyday is gonna be a blast, but you’re gonna have good days and those good days where you start the flicker of feeling alive, it’s worth any bad day that you’ll experience, even if you can’t see that on the bad days. ', '12': 'I know how you feel, and it doesn’t help when people who don’t understand tell you what they  think you should do, like it’s so easy if you just did this you wouldn’t be depressed, ugh, why didn’t I think of that? However, depression is disorder to be managed and it’s taken me a long time (and lots of therapy) to realize that there are certain things  I must force myself to do to stay one step ahead of this disorder lest I travel down the rabbit hole of despair. There is no one thing that will help, it’s a combination of things and doing them regularly. I get that it’s hard...and when depressed we reject things that we like, and things that are good for us. I also dislike when people tell me what to do, especially when they don’t suffer from the same disorder.  Sometimes the walk, yoga, healthy stuff is just not going to happen that day and it all feels so overwhelming and yes, like I’m failing. But I’ve also learned to recognize that forcing myself to do things that I know are good for me do help in the long run, even if they are hard and it feels like my legs have cement on them. I’m not even talking about a run but just a short walk outside, getting dressed has been hard before, things that are simple for others seem impossible. I talk myself through it, slowly, one step at a time. I’ve actually gone to the gym and just mindlessly gone on the elliptical, I was having some suicidal thoughts one night, having a rough time, I was getting worried, called a friend, he didn’t answer, and then called a hotline to find out it was disconnected....FmL...I was pacing around the house, anxiety was sky high, and I decided I needed to help myself before things got worse, I went to the gym and got on the elliptical and just angry worked out for 20 min. Didn’t make eye contact with anyone, had my headphones in, It was mindless, but I got my body moving and it got my head out of that pattern of beating myself up and ruminating. I have kicked and screamed and cried about how I don’t want to do these things, I don’t feel like doing them, they aren’t going to help, but then after I’ve been doing them consistently I do feel slightly better and the cloud lifts for a bit and I can see the benefit. It’s about self care and going through the motions even if it’s slow and painful. I have a mental health checklist that  some days I just look at, other days/weeks I put to good use and make my self care a priority. The right amount of sleep, a little exercise, some food, some fun stuff, some meditation or quiet time. Managing depression is not easy, do what works for you, and don’t let those other people who have no clue tell you how to “fix” it.  Find something you can tolerate as far as a little bit of exercise or movement and try to find things to do that bring you enjoyment. It’s a constant fight and sometimes all I want to do is sleep too. ', '13': 'I’m like this too now. I am just so numb from past trauma that I don’t feel anything or want to do anything anymore. I can barely even bring myself to type this up rn. I try so hard to keep moving forward because I of the people I love but it’s just so overwhelming sometimes, especially when it feels like your nervous system is attacking itself, and my psych won’t do shit about it, even though she’s the one who caused permanent damage in the first place and made me convulse and hallucinate by ripping me off multiple meds at once and throwing me on the MAX dose of not one, but TWO antidepressants all at once during a time in my life where I was basically suicidal. Fucking bitch.. Plus, I was only 17 at the time it happened. It ruined my fucking life, and now I can’t socialize because I’m too fucked up to function in this world.\n\n Anyways.. venting a bit there; but I feel your pain and want you to know you’re not alone. I want to exercise, I want to make money, I want to talk to women, I want to be able to love again, but I just don’t. There’s no logical reason why that I can think of, I just don’t. I understand that logically, you have to face your fears to *truly* become comfortable in your own skin, and that comfort is just an allusion, but it’s like my mind has just said fuck it and given up. I used to face my fears. The anxiety wasn’t fun but I was still able to get through it. Now I just don’t care at all. Having to be really self aware along with being a kid with sensory issues and a handful of mental disorders is not helping the situation at all. I am just hoping for something at this point, although I don’t know what that could be. \n\n I wish you the best of luck and I sincerely hope that you get better and find that natural drive to do things again. I am so sick of seeing many people suffering for no good reason.', '14': 'It\'s ok bro, I did not start working until I was 21 in last November. I\'m about to turn 22 now. I am still working on my GED, almost done right now once I finish the geometry chapter. I feel you. 19 is nothing, 21 is though lol. I get what you mean by:\n\n&gt; but the adult world just seems so far fetched and advanced\n\nIt\'s not. Everyone is a bunch of big children trying to present an image of something higher. There is no higher. We are children inside forever. People don\'t give a fuck, we are all in this weird crazy game and confused. Things go smooth and natural because of that. Nothing to be scared of.\n\n&gt;I am having a problem with what kind of job I’d like to get\n\nStop thinking about it from this stressful perspective. To do that, get any job you can; apply for a supermarket or whatever. Basically any job will give you real world experience and a more complete understanding of life, and then you can think more realistically when you get a deeper understanding of the value of time etc.\n\n&gt;but at the same time you want to enjoy what you’re doing right?\n\nThis is an excuse. You should instead think like so: ""I will probably enjoy any job that comes to me."" -- I push supermarket carts for a living, it\'s bad for my back and the pay is shit of course, but it\'s a very enjoyable job for me. Everyone tells me they hate that or it sounds shit. People love to be haters, but being a hater is childish &amp; inferior to acceptance of what you have. And hey, I may not be known for superficial things like creating a fuckin\' movie and making $2 billion, but I\'m known for being a really great hearted kind cool person, what really matters.\n\nMy advice is stop giving so much of a shit. That\'s good that you want to get a job that serves importance to the world -- but so what? The vast majority of people, intelligent or not, are forced to work shitty jobs before they can do what they want to do. I think if you just get a shitty job and start small from there, your mind will be clearer.', '15': ""Count me in. I'm not against my relatives/cousins/anyone except my parents, but I just prefer to stay away from them. Just be in a small circle where it consists of my parents, best friends and very closed ones. However, my family is only me, mom and dad. So, if any good-hearted/kind guests visits me and my family, haves a good chat, or even maybe stays for a couple of days or weeks, then he/she finally leaves the house, the whole environment will be quiet. Three of us will be like, mourning that happy moments we all just had few hours/days ago, but then few after hours things will get back to normal. This feeling was even worse for me, back then i was overcoming with existential crisis, would cry, within and out. This went on for about several years, it was hell, thinking bout all these 'existence' shit. Even though things are better, I'd always worry bout the future, about the events that will happen for sure."", '16': ""Take time to grieve. It's ok to feel these feelings and they will go away in that they will become memories of a good dog and some hard lessons learned. Life sometimes just sucks. You did all that you could when you realized she was missing.\n\nI have a similar story though not quite as traumatic. When I rented my house it came with a kitty. An outdoor kitty. Wimbly. Wimbly wasn't quite right in the head. It took a long time to get her to come to me and be hand fed a few treats.  She never left my small yard and lived under the house.  I travelled a lot for work which was no big deal. I had a vacation feeder filled with food for her. After a long trip and a LONG flight home from China I got home to hear Wimbly crying under the house. I had never heard Wimbly make a sound before. It was 4:00 am, cold and Wimbly wasn't much for letting me approach her anyway and it wasn't very easy to get under the house. The next day I didn't see her but that was typical. Another day went by, I got a little worried. Then day three I crawled under the house and poor Wimbly was no longer with us. I laid in the dirt under the house. I had heard her crying under the house...\n\nI buried her in the yard. I did my best to care for Wimbly, but sometimes is just doesn't work out.\n\nit will take time to heal, but you will heal. You will come to terms with what happened and make peace with your part in it."", '17': 'It’s ok man. Your parents mean well, it’s  just that they don’t know how to handle your problem and it frustrates them. It’s ok. Thy only want to help.\n\nI’ve been going through the same shit. I have friends, people want to talk to me, people at my workplace love me, I have a great gf who loves me and helps me, but somehow being at the best place I’ve ever been at, I still feel shitty every day. It’s like I got some weird fog of negativity in my brain that wouldn’t let go. I feel like I’ve gone mad but it’s just a symptom of anxiety and depression.\n\nThere is hope though. Yesterday I had good time around my girlfriend. After months of suffering, feeling like I’m not interesting or good enough for her, we went out and I enjoyed it. Of course my brain literally tries to force me to think I wasn’t having fun but I remember telling myself yesterday that this is what’s going to happen.\n\n\nThe truth is, hapiness is indeed a choice. People think it’s cliche but it really isn’t. It’s just not as simple as you think. You see, your brain is used to think negatively, for one reason or another. It feels so, so natural for us that we barely even notice it. It is wired so. When I say “hapiness is a choice”, I mean that hapiness is perspective. Hapiness is realizing that our brains are this way, and that we can choose to try and think in a different way. Not the “think happy!” Bullshit, but instead, looking at how your thoughts are irrational (some of them at least), and realizing that a different perspective can be taken. It’s that simple but also tough as fuck, since you’re pretty much wired to believe something else. It’s hard but it’s doable, and the fact I had fun with my girlfriend, that we shared a wholesome laugh in my car at a Thursday night, proves it for me. \n\nYou don’t have to go through this alone. I can’t. I have a book, called “feeing good”, which I’m reading (it’s cognitive therapy, basically what I described above), and it’s supposed to help with depression and anxiety (and it did work a bit), but I have so many questions and sometimes I get stuck in my mind or sometimes I just need to talk it out loud instead of thinking about everything which gives me a clearer perspective on what’s going on in my head. That’s where a therapist comes in handy. You said in the comments you’re going to one, and I think it’s great. I have 2, one which really helps me and moves things forward, and one who actually doesn’t do much but listen, though I love her because I just talk for an hour about all the shit in my life and I feel better letting it all out 😁\n\nAnyways, stay strong fella. Our lives can be awesome but at the end of the day, hapiness is determined by how we interpret situations. It’s discipline and a bit of work, but nothin undoable. People have gotten out of depression, people have lead good lives, you’re not alone in this.
