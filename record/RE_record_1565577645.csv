Your mileage may vary, but I have found it useful to engross myself in things that I think *might* interest me. It was easy to get into films when I was spending all day in bed anyway. So I tried branching out into classic films, and watching certain genres, there are so many out there. Free, classic books online if I had the energy for them. Politics, or philosophy if thats your bag at all. If not that, Wikipedia, the more informative and well moderated reddits (like Askhistorians and Askscience). Now I think this was avoidance for me, because it hasn't addressed that fundamental emptiness. I might not have absorbed the majority or even much of it at all. But it has meant that I know just slightly more than I did, I have experienced slightly more than I had previously experienced - even if I was stationary for days at a time and with the curtains drawn, I found there was  something incrementally, just slightly nourishing in all that, in a way that felt like some small progress.

I don’t think even people that study it for a living know that answer.\n\nI found that I started feeling better just by taking fish oil supplements. Others take anti-depressants. For some people, exercise is the thing. Others have to do all 3, plus therapy, and still have some pretty bad days.\n\nIt’s good the way you recognize this was a pretty good day. That’s a good place to start. So now is a good time to think about doing a little bit more.

They are people to, these are relationships being built in their own right, and it isn't necessarily the best thing to do sometimes. What's great about Reddit is you can get some anonymous help here and there (there are risks too, but this seems healthy so far), and hear some more perspectives. I was lucky as I had a very deep friendship with someone who helped me to not kill myself. I have known him about 20 years, and value his friendship very much. He wasn't a cure all for me, but it was a gradual part of the process. If you are open to meds, you could just get a psyc to prescribe them. Finding a good CBT person is harder, but can be SOOO worth. Actually, I would say it is so worth it. My psyc was a great guide/mentor, and I didn't fall into my emotional bumble e mentality, which was so easy for me to do when talking with others about these issues.

In some ways I wish I was one of those who depression comes to as curling grey faced in bed and refusing to move anymore. But I can\'t bring myself to do that.

It taught me so many valuable life lessons and gave me a whole new perspective on life. It’s helped me be grateful for all the amazing people I know, and all the amazing opportunities I’ve been blessed with. \n\nSince then, I’ve done my best to pass the things I’ve learned onto other people who are struggling with the same thing. I feel a strong connection with other people who have depression, and can put myself into their shoes and relate to what they’re feeling. This gives me the ability to better help them because I can better understand them.\n\nThe point being: In many ways, you’re more qualified to help people with their mental health issues, because you know what they’re going through. You can better empathize with them and relate to them. In many ways, you can help them better than someone who HASN’T experienced what they have. \n\nThere’s still periods where I fall back into depression, but I take it as a learning opportunity. If the suffering I’ve been through can help other people with their suffering, then I take it as a silver lining. There’s always a glimpse of light in the darkness, if only you’ll look for it.\n\nI’d recommend telling your therapist what you’re feeling, since they know you personally and may have a better perspective on it.

I’m a woman, but I hate when I’m around men and I know that they’re upset or struggling but it’s impossible for them to admit it. It’s absolutely okay to be upset about upsetting things. And as someone with depression, I’m upset a lot even without a concrete, external thing to be upset about. Everybody feels things. Being in denial about having emotions is only harmful to yourself and your interaction with others.\n\nAnd as a little girl who had a very emotional father, he taught me how to understand, handle, react to my emotions.

They therefore have no understanding of how to deal with it.\n\nI'm glad you've got someone you feel comfortable going to - although I don't know how much your friend's mom can help, at least you've got an ear - try not to put her in a situation where she is afraid that you might actually do something if she doesn't tell someone, though.\n\nI still think you might want to at least *talk* to a doctor about meds. I know there's a stigma around them that might put you off - and honestly they aren't without their own problems (never mind sometimes having to spend significant time trying several different kinds until you find something that works well enough for you - which can be kinda depressing in itself), but in the end they usually are worth the trouble, IMHO.\n\nMy meds (Paxil CR) don't keep me from having the deep Ds, but they do significantly curtail the vicious downward spiral of repeating the same suicidal thoughts over and over in my head. That alone allows me to manage myself much better. I'm more likely to realize what's likely causing these thoughts (most of the time it's insufficient sleep, although the pressures of daily life and the fact I tend to freeze up when under pressure or uncertain what to do are also frequent causes) and knowing the problem is half the battle, as they say.\n\nGood luck. If I can be of any help, then feel free to PM me.  Just be aware that it may take a while for me to respond because I work 55-60hrs/wk and of course have my own family and issues.

It\'s like regular people react far more easily to social impulses, whereas I need to feel like my life is threathened before I\'m able to do anything. ""Thanks"" to my anxiety, this happens pretty frequently, but there are times where even that familiar social panic clawing at my throat doesn\'t move me. \n\nPerhaps we could describe it as social paralysis. ', '1': 'As someone who has experienced depression at different periods in my life, and found ways to climb out of it,  I feel that the ""brain chemical imbalance"" answer is an excuse by the drug industry and shrinks to get and keep you drugged up.  I would describe my depression as characterized as a perception of the world around me turning colorless, with repetitive thoughts and hopeless fear, the inability to do anything productive, and lack of desire to be around people.  I would describe it more as a ""soul imbalance"".  Something happens that starts a mental spiral, and it cycles downward from there.\n\nI have found the best way to fight off its ability to start is by maintaining physical activity daily (weight lifting and swimming are excellent), staying away in winter from grey coldweather locales like the Midwest ( I moved to CA), and meditating (I bet Yoga could substitute for meditation).

You're capable of attaining an education, securing a job, having friends, going out to be social, all of which are important and can be valuable building blocks in getting to a desirable life for anyone with any medical background. I grew up in a particularly aesthetically-focused place and struggled with my sense of self until I moved to a more culturally diverse and eclectic city, where I feel much more like myself. Environment matters and it's hard to feel well in shitty context, especially given that your environment encourages habits that make the shitty part very real. About the cerebral palsy, my perspective still stands about cultural environment... I dated a man with SMA, wheelchair bound, and it was acceptable for me to help him eat at restaurants, walk around together, et cetera. I don't think this is equally accepted in all cities and having the relatively open minded background helped both of us to be more comfortable in public.\n\nMaybe it would be worth working on what's workable short term (diet, medication?

I know in my head that what I\'m experiencing is depression, but if I try to minimize it by saying ""I\'m not depressed, I\'m just...out of sorts."" it allows me some space to process and move on with my day, or come up with a quick fix nap or coffee or something else. \n\nI don\'t really care what other non-mental health professionals think about depression. It\'s not a feeling of guilt or shame for me. It\'s like my own way of fighting back against depression, actually, by not saying it. I can talk about it in therapy just fine, and talk about it with my wife and parents just fine but it\'s a more clinical discussion usually, rather than experiencing those emotions at that time.

I know that objectively I'm doing better by societal measures, but then I get weird feelings like wishing I was more depressed again because it was so much easier, which seems pretty dysfunctional to me. I've almost always had low sex drive, although I don't know if it's depression or what, so I'm kind of grey-area-ace somewhere, which I don't mind except that I have an SO and that seems hard on them (even if they don't complain).\n\nFor trauma, I think the wishing I was back there is what lingers for me. And some paranoia that people are just faking understanding, or will leave me if I ever regress. I still have problems with anhedonia sometimes, which feels a little like blunted emotions, just tied to something specific. Also, it might be possible for PTSD to be in your mix, but I'd ask a professional.\n\nJust because you've gotten really far doesn't mean that you don't still have stuff you want to do. I'm glad you're proud of your progress. I think that the last little bit always feels harder to climb, and it's okay to ask for more help getting to where you'd like to be. Not a lot helps me personally--mostly a combo of friends and proper meds and different therapies. Also, going out and doing stuff that I find exciting, even if I know it will be transient. But I try to do that stuff with other people, so I have those visceral memories linked up. It can backfire if that person becomes negative in my life, but it's generally fun at the time, and kind of fond in retrospect, which is better than nothing.\n\nSome people benefit a lot from mindfulness, and there are a bunch of techniques out there, so maybe you could also consider that?

It is a false hate, born from insidious machinations of depression, and it took me a very long time to realize this, about 10 years. \n\nThis was 2, maybe 3 years ago, and I was on the verge of breaking up with my boyfriend over text because of emotional issues going on at the time, to no one's surprise.

He instead drove 3 hours to meet me and confronted me about why I was trying to end things in the first place, leading to a long discussion of my issues for the umpteenth time, and we both realized at that point that my irrational hatred for myself and desire to destroy was not of myself but of something more sinister, seeking to increase my own suffering using my body as a vessel.\n\nI describe it in such a way because imagining my depression as something separate, almost physical like a demon to be banished, helps me tune out the unending hatred I bear towards myself. The hatred is irrational, so instead of fighting fire with fire, I seek to live a life that gives me physical proof that I'm not a piece of shit, that I'm loved, and that I've lived well. The evidence I use to rationalize that I can't be as bad a person as I think, and therefore what I think is wrong. It's helped me shift perspectives from someone absolutely hating themselves all the time to someone who can at least take small pride in some things, who is at least somewhat okay with himself, and hopefully who will one day learn to like or even love himself.

That\'s something, at least. \n\nYour problem resonates with me. It\'s like regular people react far more easily to social impulses, whereas I need to feel like my life is threathened before I\'m able to do anything. ""Thanks"" to my anxiety, this happens pretty frequently, but there are times where even that familiar social panic clawing at my throat doesn\'t move me. \n\nPerhaps we could describe it as social paralysis. ', '1': 'As someone who has experienced depression at different periods in my life, and found ways to climb out of it,  I feel that the ""brain chemical imbalance"" answer is an excuse by the drug industry and shrinks to get and keep you drugged up.  I would describe my depression as characterized as a perception of the world around me turning colorless, with repetitive thoughts and hopeless fear, the inability to do anything productive, and lack of desire to be around people.  I would describe it more as a ""soul imbalance"".  Something happens that starts a mental spiral, and it cycles downward from there.\n\nI have found the best way to fight off its ability to start is by maintaining physical activity daily (weight lifting and swimming are excellent), staying away in winter from grey coldweather locales like the Midwest ( I moved to CA), and meditating (I bet Yoga could substitute for meditation). ', '2': ""It sounds (to me) like you are a capable person struggling in an environment that doesn't fit. You're capable of attaining an education, securing a job, having friends, going out to be social, all of which are important and can be valuable building blocks in getting to a desirable life for anyone with any medical background. I grew up in a particularly aesthetically-focused place and struggled with my sense of self until I moved to a more culturally diverse and eclectic city, where I feel much more like myself. Environment matters and it's hard to feel well in shitty context, especially given that your environment encourages habits that make the shitty part very real. About the cerebral palsy, my perspective still stands about cultural environment... I dated a man with SMA, wheelchair bound, and it was acceptable for me to help him eat at restaurants, walk around together, et cetera. I don't think this is equally accepted in all cities and having the relatively open minded background helped both of us to be more comfortable in public.\n\nMaybe it would be worth working on what's workable short term (diet, medication? I don't know the course of treatment for Crohn's), and developing an idea of what the best long term life would look like, including where you are. From there, those building blocks you've already established? Really helpful. \n\nI hope you're feeling a bit better by the time you read this. Sorry about the girl. Mixed signals happen, it's not your fault."", '3': ""I have been doing this for years, and I can tell you assuredly I do it because I hate myself, intensely. It is a false hate, born from insidious machinations of depression, and it took me a very long time to realize this, about 10 years. \n\nThis was 2, maybe 3 years ago, and I was on the verge of breaking up with my boyfriend over text because of emotional issues going on at the time, to no one's surprise. We were going to spend a week together at the beach with my parents, but I told him to stay home and leave me be. He instead drove 3 hours to meet me and confronted me about why I was trying to end things in the first place, leading to a long discussion of my issues for the umpteenth time, and we both realized at that point that my irrational hatred for myself and desire to destroy was not of myself but of something more sinister, seeking to increase my own suffering using my body as a vessel.\n\nI describe it in such a way because imagining my depression as something separate, almost physical like a demon to be banished, helps me tune out the unending hatred I bear towards myself. The hatred is irrational, so instead of fighting fire with fire, I seek to live a life that gives me physical proof that I'm not a piece of shit, that I'm loved, and that I've lived well. The evidence I use to rationalize that I can't be as bad a person as I think, and therefore what I think is wrong. It's helped me shift perspectives from someone absolutely hating themselves all the time to someone who can at least take small pride in some things, who is at least somewhat okay with himself, and hopefully who will one day learn to like or even love himself. "", '4': 'I\'m almost afraid to say it, because by saying it I give it weight, and power in my life. It\'s like ""He who must not be named"", right? For me, I say ""I\'m having a really rough morning"" or ""I\'m so unmotivated."" I know in my head that what I\'m experiencing is depression, but if I try to minimize it by saying ""I\'m not depressed, I\'m just...out of sorts."" it allows me some space to process and move on with my day, or come up with a quick fix nap or coffee or something else. \n\nI don\'t really care what other non-mental health professionals think about depression. It\'s not a feeling of guilt or shame for me. It\'s like my own way of fighting back against depression, actually, by not saying it. I can talk about it in therapy just fine, and talk about it with my wife and parents just fine but it\'s a more clinical discussion usually, rather than experiencing those emotions at that time. ', '5': ""Maybe not the answer your looking for.\nBut researching topics that cause depression can help a lot. It did for me.\n\nTopics like\n\nHormones(testosterone, cortisol, proclatin, estrogen)\nChecimal imbalances (dopamine , seratonin)\nNutrition (how it affects you)\n*pottasium \n\n\nWhen you research these areas you can almost identify the problem. By me doing so, I understand my mood /behavior/and thinking patterns much better.\n\n\nI understand why I feel lonely. (Its not that I'm lonely and friendless)\n\nThe reason I'm feeling lonely could be because of a  dopamine defiency in my brain (likely caused by overstimulation, in my case, which alters my way of thinking dramatically And I'll be unaware of it sometimes)\n\n\nBeing unaware of certain things , we fall into traps (loops)"", '6': ""There are other subs that will possibly be more helpful (check the sidebar--I've been browsing /r/mentalhealth and they seem nice), but for now...\n\nI'm TOLD I'm in recovery, and that I'm way better than before, but it's hard for me to believe. I know that objectively I'm doing better by societal measures, but then I get weird feelings like wishing I was more depressed again because it was so much easier, which seems pretty dysfunctional to me. I've almost always had low sex drive, although I don't know if it's depression or what, so I'm kind of grey-area-ace somewhere, which I don't mind except that I have an SO and that seems hard on them (even if they don't complain).\n\nFor trauma, I think the wishing I was back there is what lingers for me. And some paranoia that people are just faking understanding, or will leave me if I ever regress. I still have problems with anhedonia sometimes, which feels a little like blunted emotions, just tied to something specific. Also, it might be possible for PTSD to be in your mix, but I'd ask a professional.\n\nJust because you've gotten really far doesn't mean that you don't still have stuff you want to do. I'm glad you're proud of your progress. I think that the last little bit always feels harder to climb, and it's okay to ask for more help getting to where you'd like to be. Not a lot helps me personally--mostly a combo of friends and proper meds and different therapies. Also, going out and doing stuff that I find exciting, even if I know it will be transient. But I try to do that stuff with other people, so I have those visceral memories linked up. It can backfire if that person becomes negative in my life, but it's generally fun at the time, and kind of fond in retrospect, which is better than nothing.\n\nSome people benefit a lot from mindfulness, and there are a bunch of techniques out there, so maybe you could also consider that? I usually work on calming down, but I've heard of people working on feeling happy or accepting sadness, that kind of thing."", '7': 'Thanks! I\'m glad I can help somehow :)\n\nJust to expand a bit more, I have become more honest and straightforward with people about how I feel. And while I do believe that it has been much better for me, it\'s not all sunshines and rainbows, precisely because of the reason that people tend to very easily jump in and say ""You\'re too sensitive"".\n\nBut as I\'ve underlined in my previous post, they\'re just as sensitive, if not even more. I think it\'s just a ""defensive"" response to say something like that. Like, it\'s to put themselves in this ""higher position"", where they think they\'re the more rational ones. \n\nThey are not.\n', '8': ""I can relate. Your mileage may vary, but I have found it useful to engross myself in things that I think *might* interest me. It was easy to get into films when I was spending all day in bed anyway. So I tried branching out into classic films, and watching certain genres, there are so many out there. Free, classic books online if I had the energy for them. Politics, or philosophy if thats your bag at all. If not that, Wikipedia, the more informative and well moderated reddits (like Askhistorians and Askscience). Now I think this was avoidance for me, because it hasn't addressed that fundamental emptiness. I might not have absorbed the majority or even much of it at all. But it has meant that I know just slightly more than I did, I have experienced slightly more than I had previously experienced - even if I was stationary for days at a time and with the curtains drawn, I found there was  something incrementally, just slightly nourishing in all that, in a way that felt like some small progress. "", '9': ""Caffeine Pills, yo. You can pick up a bottle of 500 100mg tablets for about $20. Pretty cheap, and they're strong enough that if I take *two* I feel a bit uncomfortably energetic. Also a lot faster then drinking a whole cup of coffee. I've been taking them for years now, and I swear by them.\n\nI feel like people get a bit weirded out about taking pills, (whereas coffee is more socially acceptable) but I just find them more efficient. And this is coming from someone who rarely feels much on a standard energy drink. (Red Bull, Coffee, Soda, whatever)"", '10': 'There are a lot of theories about the causes of depression. There’s obviously the emotional part - lack of social support, suffering an emotional blow, etc.\n\nBut there’s also the physical part. And I think that’s where it gets confusing. Some sources say it’s a lack of serotonin. But what causes the lack of serotonin? I don’t think even people that study it for a living know that answer.\n\nI found that I started feeling better just by taking fish oil supplements. Others take anti-depressants. For some people, exercise is the thing. Others have to do all 3, plus therapy, and still have some pretty bad days.\n\nIt’s good the way you recognize this was a pretty good day. That’s a good place to start. So now is a good time to think about doing a little bit more.

Actually, after having gone to therapy, I completely agree with you.\nI was going and telling these people all of me feelings and worries and realized that, hey! They are people to, these are relationships being built in their own right, and it isn't necessarily the best thing to do sometimes. What's great about Reddit is you can get some anonymous help here and there (there are risks too, but this seems healthy so far), and hear some more perspectives. I was lucky as I had a very deep friendship with someone who helped me to not kill myself. I have known him about 20 years, and value his friendship very much. He wasn't a cure all for me, but it was a gradual part of the process. If you are open to meds, you could just get a psyc to prescribe them. Finding a good CBT person is harder, but can be SOOO worth. Actually, I would say it is so worth it. My psyc was a great guide/mentor, and I didn't fall into my emotional bumble e mentality, which was so easy for me to do when talking with others about these issues. Your parents now know, and next step is to continue to take care of yourself to better your situation.\n"", '12': 'First of all, love your username. \n\nSecond, I’m not a care worker, but depression and suicide run in my family, so it’s something I’m all too familiar with.\n\nHaving depression was the absolute worst period of my entire life, but in many ways, I’m grateful it happened because it made me into the person I am today. It taught me so many valuable life lessons and gave me a whole new perspective on life. It’s helped me be grateful for all the amazing people I know, and all the amazing opportunities I’ve been blessed with. \n\nSince then, I’ve done my best to pass the things I’ve learned onto other people who are struggling with the same thing. I feel a strong connection with other people who have depression, and can put myself into their shoes and relate to what they’re feeling. This gives me the ability to better help them because I can better understand them.\n\nThe point being: In many ways, you’re more qualified to help people with their mental health issues, because you know what they’re going through. You can better empathize with them and relate to them. In many ways, you can help them better than someone who HASN’T experienced what they have. \n\nThere’s still periods where I fall back into depression, but I take it as a learning opportunity. If the suffering I’ve been through can help other people with their suffering, then I take it as a silver lining. There’s always a glimpse of light in the darkness, if only you’ll look for it.\n\nI’d recommend telling your therapist what you’re feeling, since they know you personally and may have a better perspective on it. I wish you the best of luck in the days ahead. You can do this! ', '13': 'Yeah. In some ways I wish I was one of those who depression comes to as curling grey faced in bed and refusing to move anymore. But I can\'t bring myself to do that. The struggle to pretend it\'s all OK for just one more day sometimes helps a bit. The effort to pretend at happiness can sometimes help me get to a better place, just for a while. And when it all comes crashing down I can\'t help but claw myself into a presentable state and keep going. I\'m like a robot, hollowed out inside and filled with rust and rot, but still going through the motions, a smiling mask painted on for the world. It seems I might fit the definition of ""high functioning"" but that term\'s a joke. I\'m no more funtional than anyone else who sinks this deep. I just have camoflage instincts.

I wish men’s emotions were valued more. I’m a woman, but I hate when I’m around men and I know that they’re upset or struggling but it’s impossible for them to admit it. It’s absolutely okay to be upset about upsetting things. And as someone with depression, I’m upset a lot even without a concrete, external thing to be upset about. Everybody feels things. Being in denial about having emotions is only harmful to yourself and your interaction with others.\n\nAnd as a little girl who had a very emotional father, he taught me how to understand, handle, react to my emotions. He taught me how to talk about my feelings and be able to analyze whether I was truly this upset about the weather or if I was just feeling depressed. My emotional father was one of the greatest gifts I had.\n\nNever be afraid to be emotional. ', '15': ""I think the mistake you've made is assuming that their intention was to help.

Even the little things. \n\nAnd to answer your second question, I have found it in a way. I have found someone who makes me feel like the real me. I feel like with them I don't have to pretend to be someone else. I feel like they understand me and I understand them more than anyone else ever could. Theres been a few difficulties but I think we may finally be together very soon. And this is major, because for a while I thought my deepest fear of being alone forever was a reality. But honestly it was when I started to believe that I didn't need someone to be happy that opportunities started to fall into place. I'm not saying give up trying for something, I'm not really sure Whatcom saying really. \n\nAnd I mean it. It sounds stupid that someone can genuinely care about someone they don't know. Someone they've never met or seen, just words on a screen. But I'm an extremely emotional person and I truly care about people.

Why can't they just let you be you.\n\nI think it's something that's less prevalent in older people, if you want to find more supporting *accepting* people I would try some slightly older or join a depression support group and the people there will just let you be you because they're going through the same thing, I should probably join a support group myself. I think I'll take my own advice, hah\nSomething just occurred to me, the difficulty some people might have accepting our depression is because I usually tell them after I've gotten to know them so, they've built up this image of me and they can't reconcile or adjust to this new understanding of me.""}"
